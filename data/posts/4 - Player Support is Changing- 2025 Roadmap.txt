This year we're making substantial improvements to our Player Support services. You've told us loud and clear that we need to do better, and throughout 2025, that's exactly what we plan to do. Our goal is to enhance your overall experience, ensure you receive the high-quality support you deserve, and rebuild your trust in Player Support.

The Player Support Survey we sent out in December 2024 has directly informed our work. We wanted to make sure we're focusing on the areas that are most important to our community.

Following that, we've ensured that all areas of the studio, from OSRS and RS3 Developers to  Community Management, Player Support, and beyond, have all worked together to make sure we're addressing your biggest concerns.

Here are some of the key results from that survey, which 7,000 players completed:

Winter 2025 and Beyond

Before we get into our future, let's recap what we've done recently.

Live since January 2025

The advanced spam filters we implemented in January 2025 have resulted 5,455 mutes, an average of 92 per day. Although the initial impact may not have been immediately noticeable to all players, we're continually refining these filters based on real-time data and feedback. You should expect to see further improvements in the reduction of unwanted spam as we enhance our systems throughout 2025.

Live since 26th March 2025

Players who report bots and macroing will now be notified if their report results in action, as 89% of those who filled out the December survey have suggested. We hope this change will help you see that reporting rule-breakers really does make a difference. These messages will be sent to your Player Inbox, and we'll look to extend this to other in-game report types later this year.

Phase 1 ï¿½ Live Since 23rd April 2025

Now, onto the future! This roadmap outlines exactly how we're going to improve our Player Support services, with a clear focus on three core pillars:

While we have clear goals in mind, there's every chance that our plans may change. If that happens, you'll be the first to know!

We know that Jagex Accounts offer significantly stronger security than Legacy RuneScape accounts - Legacy accounts are four times more likely to be hijacked.

However, we've noticed that many players aren't fully using the enhanced security features that come with Jagex Accounts. This can leave accounts more vulnerable and, in rare cases, result in players losing access entirely.

We want to be open and realistic with you. Live chat is new to us, and we know implementing it fully will be a challenge. There might be bumps along the way, it might not always work perfectly right from the start, and we might have to adjust our approach based on your feedback or technical considerations. That said, we're committed to making it work, and we'll always keep you informed about how things are going. If something isn't working as intended, we'll let you know and tell you exactly how we're fixing it.

Building on these achievements, we're now turning our primary attention to Real-World Trading (RWT).

Our detection and removal capabilities are stronger than ever. While eliminating RWT entirely isn't realistic, you will see a noticeable reduction in its activity within the game.

We'll start to share more regular updates and detailed statistics on our efforts in tackling both botting and RWT. Is there particular stat you'd like to see? Let us know and we'll try to include it in the next update!

We know there are other challenges affecting your ability to play and engage with vital services. We want you to know we're aware of these issues and are looking into potential improvements we can make, though we're not yet in a position to detail what and when, and as soon as we are, we'll let you know. These are some of the main concerns that we've heard from player feedback:

Throughout our quest for improvement, your feedback will be crucial in ensuring that we're on the right track. To help us understand exactly how well we're performing and to spot areas where we can improve, you can expect additional Player Support surveys coming your way via email and on our social channels. We've also recently introduced short, in-game satisfaction surveys.

These quick, unobtrusive surveys will appear occasionally while you're in-game. They will only ever show when you're in a safe area and not actively busy with any tasks. They take just seconds to complete, but the insight they provide is invaluable to us.

Please keep sharing your thoughts through these surveys, they genuinely help us deliver the level of service you deserve!

Your voices have already led to significant changes, and we'll continue to listen and respond as we build the best possible support experience for our community.

Thank you for your continued support!
