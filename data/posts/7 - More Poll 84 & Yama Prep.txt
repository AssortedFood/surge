Poll 84 updates keep coming in, and this week brings one of the most-anticipated updates from the poll, as well as a minigame QoL. Let's dive right in...

Today is the day for those who were eagerly waiting for the Zulrah update from Poll 84: the ability to deal Melee damage to Zulrah is here!

To provide some context, contrary to the main game, it was possible to engage Zulrah with Melee directly in Leagues: Raging Echoes. The interesting results we saw in Leagues led to this specific update - you can now use Halberd attacks to damage Zulrah.

That said, Melee does not replace your traditional Mage or Range strategies at Zulrah; it's a fun alternative if you want to experiment with different play styles. We�ve tested the best mainhand Halberd available (the Noxious Halberd), paired with high-tier gear like Torva and Oathplate, and while Melee offers some benefits, it doesn�t outcompete the current best-in-slot setups for Mage or Range.

So when might Melee come in handy?

In other words, this update offers a fresh option for those who want to switch things up, without drastically altering the core mechanics of Zulrah fights. Most importantly, the big snake is right there, it only makes sense that a slightly longer weapon should be able to hit it!

One for the Giant's Foundry enjoyers: If you're quick on the clicks and hit the bonus action shortly after it appears, you'll not only finish your sword faster - you'll now also recover a portion of any missed quality (given any was missing). This should make your bonus actions even more rewarding, giving you a little extra for your precision. If you weren't speedy enough for your sword to recover quality though, don't worry - you'll still gain the usual progress on your sword.

One moment you�re performing interpretive carrot dances for a disillusioned bunny in a dingy underground pub, and the next� it�s time to sweep up the chocolate, pack away the eggs, and say goodbye to Easter.

Yup, the 2025 Easter event has officially hopped off into the sunset. If you didn�t get a chance to play it, there�s always next year! Assuming the Easter Bunny doesn�t unionise.

This week's game update has packed away the vegetables, cleared out the pub, and returned the bunny to his natural state: unconscious until 2026.

...

�Hang on, that�s it this week?�

Yup. That�s the blog...

Okay, fine - there�s a bit more context to add.

We know this week�s update is a small one, but that lets us make sure we'll be prepped and ready for the launch of our brand new, endgame duo boss, Yama - coming next week, on May 14th!

Therefore, we�re putting all our energy into making sure Yama�s debut is as easy as possible. So, if you're wondering why this week's update is a small one then, blame Yama - just do it quietly; there's no telling how he might react if he hears you...

But let us be clear: Yama is not messing around. This lad has near unlimited power and could wipe you from existence whenever he felt like it.

Make sure that you are prepared, because one week today, you'll be able to face the Master of Pacts! And in the meantime, you can find a duo to take on the challenge together, unless you plan to brave the fight solo. You and who?

Yesterday, we pushed out a Client update, which brought with it a long-awaited fix to Loot Tracker!

We've fixed a long standing bug where Loot Tracker databases can become corrupted, manifesting in game with noticeable stutters when ground items spawn, and in worst case scenarios, may have resulted in a crash. The fix addresses this moving forwards; however, for anyone already affected, there's a manual step to fix your current Loot Tracker.

This process may take up to a minute and may slow your game while running, so we recommend finding a safe area before running these steps.

To chat more about mobile updates, remember we have a dedicated mobile section in our official Discord server.

Another little update for you, before we look to improve the Bank interface, we've taken your feedback regarding the work that we mentioned in Poll 84. As a result we've come up with a second version after we discussed the following feedback:

Hopefully this provides you with a look that's both cleaner and more practical. Make sure to let us know what you think of these changes for the well beloved bank!
