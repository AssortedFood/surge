No Old School update is complete without a grab bag of quirky QoL tweaks and fixes! This batch of updates is packed with the kind of changes that don�t steal the spotlight but still deserve their time to shine. From gorilla behaviour tweaks to Bird Nests, here�s what�s fresh in the land of Gielinor.

After completing Monkey Madness II, you�ve proven yourself more than capable of handling Gielinor�s primate problems - so why are Tortured and demonic gorillas still acting like you're invading their jungle gym? With this change, we�ve made it so that they�ll no longer be aggressive post-quest. On top of that, they will now swap Prayers for every 70 damage taken instead of 50, giving you a bit more breathing room during fights.

Edit: Alongside the above change we have also removed the �six successful attacks� trigger for Demonic Gorilla's prayer switching. More like Demonic Go-Chilla, am I right guys... guys?

Ever feel like you log in and immediately forget what you were doing? Now you�ll be greeted by a random "Did You Know?" tip offering helpful reminders, fun factoids, or the occasional game mechanic you might�ve missed. You can customise the message colours in your settings or turn them altogether off if you're too wise for tooltips. We�ll be expanding this feature over time with even more nuggets of wisdom!

Good news for nesters! Snagging a Beginner Clue Scroll from a Bird Nest on members� worlds no longer makes the nest vanish into the void.

Also, opening Bird Nests will now auto-queue, letting you crack through your whole stash with a single click. Much easier on your poor fingers, although you�ll still need to open Clue Nests manually. If you prefer to open Bird Nests the old way, spam-clicking remains a viable option.

The Warmth bar during Wintertodt games was getting a little bulky - especially when the arena was packed. We�ve made it narrower and cleaner, so it won�t clutter up your screen. On top of that, your HP bar won�t awkwardly overlap with the Warmth bar when you take cold damage. It�s a subtle update, but your eyeballs will thank you!

You can now toggle off the falling snow overlays seen in places like Waterbirth Island. This one�s for anyone who finds the effect visually uncomfortable or distracting � a small setting with a big impact for accessibility! Be warned that in places where damage usually accompanies falling snow, you will still be affected. The changes are kind to your eyes, not your HP.

If you've ever scoured the crates in the Tower of Life during the quest, only to be met with the crushing disappointment of finding nothing, you�ll be glad to hear that from now on you�ll always get something from those crates.
