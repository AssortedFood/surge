This week brings a whole host of Yama or Chasm of Fire-related tweaks, we're hitting you with a big ol' list!

Plus, some hotfixes from last week:

In addition to these tweaks, we know you're curious about the Yama drop rates. In case you haven't seen it yet, we've provided the Wiki with detailed drop rates awhile ago, which you can see here - go check it out!

Since last Friday�s hotfix adventure, we�ve made some significant changes to Contracts based on your feedback.

First up, Yama will no longer have increased HP on any Contract except for the Contract of Bloodied Blows and Contract of Glyphic Attenutation. Yama's HP is slightly reduced on both of the aforementioned Contracts too:

On the topic of Contract of Bloodied Blows, we've lowered Yama's prayer penetration on magic and ranged attack from 10% to 5%.

On top of these adjustments, a good chunk of feedback made clear that Phase 3 for a lot of these fights was pretty enjoyable, while Phases 1 and 2 felt like a bit of a slog - particularly frustrating when a small mistake can kill you. With that in mind, all of Yama's Contracts will trigger phase transitions at 75% and 50% HP rather than 66% and 33% HP. This means you'll spend more time taking on the toughest part of the fight, but the HP reductions should mean that kills are a bit snappier.

Here's a few smaller changes we�re making:

Additionally, you can now bring Yama 100 Noted Pineapple Pizzas (his favourite!) to persuade him to let you fight him in his empowered form. This fight is intended to give you much-needed practice for the toughest Contracts of Worm, Catalyst and Shard Acquisition, but you�ll receive regular loot.

Naturally, these changes do make these Contracts easier than before, so we've compiled a list of the first among you to complete the Purifying Sigil, to make sure that players who stepped up to the challenge even when it seemed insurmountable are remembered by the history books, let's take a look.

We'd like to say a huge congratulations to everybody out there who's completed any Contracts so far, we hope to see some of you tackling these adjusted Contracts and sharing your thoughts with us!

As part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining a healthy in-game economy, we're making a change to the Grand Exchange tax rate. We understand that any update involving your hard-earned gold can be sensitive, so we want to be fully transparent about the reasons behind this change and how it will affect your gameplay.

Why Change the GE Tax Rate?

The amount of GP entering the game has steadily increased over the years, but our systems for removing that GP, known as "money sinks", haven�t kept pace. A change like increasing the GE tax is a meaningful step towards restoring economic balance, helping to curb inflation and preserve the value of your wealth.

The goal here isn�t to punish trade, but to ensure that Old School continues to have a vibrant and sustainable economy for years to come. Increasing the GE tax is one of the most effective ways we can do that.

Here�s what�s changing:

Improvements to Item Sinks

Alongside the tax rate change, we�ve also taken the chance to give the item sink system a bit of a clean-up!

In case you�re not familiar: when you buy or sell items on the Grand Exchange, most of the tax you pay gets deleted straight out of the game, helping remove GP from circulation. However, a small slice of that tax pie is also used by the game to buy certain items from players and sink them into the void, permanently deleting them from the economy. This keeps high-supply items from getting too out of hand and helps prices stay balanced over time.

In this update, we�re refining the item sink system further:

Finally, after reviewing item performance and value over time, we've removed the following items from the sink list entirely:

Some items on this list might seem too low-price to be worth sinking. In most cases, the real issue is the sheer volume of these items entering the game. We think the GP is better directed toward other, more effective sinks.

You�ll still pay tax when trading these items, but the game won�t be scooping them up and deleting them anymore. We hope these changes will let us focus your taxes on the items that are most heavily in need of an item sink, while still removing plenty of gold from the game overall.

We�ve also made some low-value and early-game utility items fully exempt from GE tax. This includes things like low-tier food, Energy Potions, teleport tablets, early-game ammo, and Mind Runes. These items are useful for newer and lower-level players, and taxing them didn�t really sink much gold, but it did make the early game just a little less friendly. So we�ve cleaned that up!

At the end of the day, this isn�t just about numbers - it�s about keeping the Old School economy healthy, so your GP stays valuable and prices stay fair. We�ll be monitoring these changes closely, and as always, we�d love to hear your thoughts.

We�re checking in - and we�d love your input!

At the end of last year, we asked for your thoughts on Jagex Player Support: what was working, what wasn�t, and where you wanted to see improvements. Your feedback in the December 2024 survey was incredibly valuable and directly shaped the Player Support roadmap we shared in April for both RuneScape and Old School.

Now, we�re back with a follow-up survey to see how we�re doing. What are your thoughts on the Roadmap? Have the changes we�ve made improved your experience? Are there still areas we need to focus on? Whether you�ve recently interacted with Player Support or simply have suggestions, we want to hear from you.

The survey will be live from 29 May to 5 June, and you can complete it here.

This is the first in a series of regular check-ins, and it only takes a few minutes to complete. Every response helps us make Player Support better for everyone, so thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts.

If you're left wanting more Amascut content, you're in luck - RuneScape: Shadows of Amascut is set to be published later this year! You can pre-order this novel direct from Titan, from your local bookstore or Amazon. Here�s the synopsis:

Was the Hereditas Expedition doomed from the start? Led by Pontifex Bilrach, the Mahjarrat must find the artifacts of the dead god Tumeken and complete the Ritual of Rejuvenation, otherwise they face extinction. Forced to work together by Zaros, the Mahjarrat form an uneasy alliance, though they all have their own ambitions.

Having found only sand and false hope wandering through the Kharidian Desert, the search is becoming ever more frustrating and the casualties mount as the humans die for the Mahjarrat cause. The desert is vast and full of danger, the sun is oppressive, and there are traitors in their midst. Can the Mahjarrat succeed despite these impossible odds?

Like the other two recent novels from Titan - Gift of Guthix and Fall of Hallowvale - Shadow of Amascut builds on in-game content from both Old School and RuneScape, filling the gaps in lore and introducing characters both new and recognisable. Ideal for lorehounds or anyone who enjoys a good story!
