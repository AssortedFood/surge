Interface Uplift Changes




This week brings in the first batch of changes from our Interface Uplift blog. Let's take a look!



Chugging Barrel Improvements


Tired of jumping back and forth between your Bank and Potion Storage just to top up your Chugging Barrel? We hear you. Now, when you hit the 'Load' button, your barrel can snatch potions from both your Bank and Potion Storage at the same time - no interface gymnastics required.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





There’s even a new bank setting so you can decide whether your barrel raids both storages or just the one you’ve got open. To keep things crystal clear, chat messages will tell you exactly how many doses came from each spot - so more potions, less clicking!

Multi Cannon


Ever wish you could load your Dwarven Multicannon with just the right number of cannonballs without wasting a single one? Now you can! The new 'Load-X' option lets you pick exactly how many cannonballs to feed your cannon, so you can go full-on siege mode, or just tickle a few mobs. Handy in spots where you place a cannon to pull in agression, but are otherwise barraging down stacks - such as Smoke Devils.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





Want to change your default load? No problem - the amount can be customised right in the settings menu. Boom.

Barrows Prayer


Nothing ruins a Barrows run faster than not noticing your Prayer getting sapped by those spooky brothers. To save you from accidentally running dry, we’ve added a chat message that pops up whenever your Prayer is drained - right alongside the classic floating face effect.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





Now it’s crystal clear when your Prayer’s taking a hit, so you can react faster and keep that HP from falling.



Bank All Your Shame at ToB


Dying in the Theatre of Blood is never fun, but reclaiming your loot just got a little less soul-crushing. The ToB death chest now has a Bank all button.




Simply unlock your chest, hit the button, and all items will be sent straight to your bank in one click. Perfect for when you want to rage quit with feeling.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!



Birdhouse Seed Warning


Accidentally chucking high-value seeds into your Fossil Island birdhouses? Ouch. To save your GP from flying away, we’ve added a toggleable warning when depositing seeds above a value you choose. Head into the settings menu to turn the warning on and set your personal threshold.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





When you try to plonk in a pricey seed, a friendly chat message will pop up, making sure you’re really, really sure before you commit.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





Now your birdhouses can stay full without your bank taking a hit!



See Every Bonus, Big or Small


Ever worn a piece of Inquisitor’s armour and wondered if that tiny 0.5% damage and accuracy boost was really doing anything? Or if your Graceful boots were actually helping with run energy? We’ve fixed that.




The Set Effects menu now shows the bonuses from each individual piece of an outfit, as well as the full set bonus if you’ve got the whole thing equipped. Whether you’re rocking partial Inquisitor’s, Graceful, or one of the many skilling or combat outfits with tiered bonuses, you can now see exactly what each piece is contributing.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





No more guessing - your stats window now tells the whole story. Equip your gear, check your boosts, and feel smug about every little bonus you earn.



Suggested Worlds Made Clickable


Tired of manually switching worlds for your favourite minigames? Now, on the Grouping tab, the suggested world for each activity is a clickable button.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





Click it, confirm the prompt, and you’re in the recommended world without any extra fiddling. Whether you’re heading to Fishing Trawler, Barbarian Assault, or any other activity with a suggested world, hop to it!







Other Changes



Fire and Infernal capes will now keep their fiery textures when teleporting, instead of briefly swapping to a static version.
Fixed the Slayer cape perk so players can now get back-to-back Zuk tasks as intended.
Fixed some blocked ground near Taverley that was stopping players from walking through.
The four bandana eyepatches can now be used for a clue that requires a bandana.
Bandana eyepatches once again have the correct colour inventory icon.
The ring of stone, and similar items, no longer break you out of being tethered to scenery at Tempoross.
The new icon that denotes mobile users is now automatically hidden in the Bounty Hunter lobby area.
