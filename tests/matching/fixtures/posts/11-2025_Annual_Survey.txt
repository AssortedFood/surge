It is that time again. We are opening the 2025 Annual Survey and we want to hear from you. Your answers help us understand what you enjoy, what needs work, and where to focus next. Last year’s survey shaped plans across the team and we are looking to you again to guide the future of Old School!

What to expect
   
Around 30-minutes to complete, much shorter than last year!
Straightforward questions about your experience with Old School, from day to day play to bigger updates.
Space to share your views in your own words.
A clear way to tell us what matters most to you next.
We're asking you a lot of important questions, so to thank you for your time and participation, we're going to be giving away 50 x $50 gift vouchers! These will go to randomly selected users who have completed the survey in full. T&Cs here.
How we use your answers

The survey begins with a short note about data protection and how your responses are handled. In short, your answers are used internally by Jagex research teams only, and you will not receive any third-party marketing because you took part. If you have questions about the survey, you can reach the team at Research@Jagex.com

Tips before you start
Set aside some time so you can answer without rushing.
Desktop or laptop is usually the smoothest way to complete longer surveys.
If you need to step away, try to finish a page before you do.

That is everything from us. Thank you for taking part and helping us make Old School better for everyone!

The Old School Team.
