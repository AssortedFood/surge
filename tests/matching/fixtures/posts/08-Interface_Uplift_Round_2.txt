Hovering over the world map icon on desktop (with tooltips enabled) now displays 'World Map' along with the desktop shortcut 'Ctrl+M'.
A rogue full stop has been spotted, rounded up, and removed! The level 93 Meiyerditch shortcut in the Agility guide is now punctuation-consistent.

Interface Uplift




This week brings in the second batch of changes from our Interface Uplift blog. Let's take a look!



Desktop Minimap Toggle


If you’ve ever played OSRS on mobile, you’ll know the joy of tucking away the minimap to free up some precious screen space, especially handy when you’re trying to tap around a boss arena or keep your UI clean while skilling!




Well, desktop players, it’s your turn! You can now right-click the world map icon and minimise your minimap just like on mobile. Your Hitpoints, Prayer, Run Energy, and Special Attack orbs will neatly stack up in the corner, leaving you with more breathing room to focus on the action. Just a heads up, this option is only available on the resizable layout.

Quick-starting Verzik


We know the Theatre of Blood (ToB) is all about high stakes and sharp execution - not sitting through dialogue you’ve already heard a dozen times. To help you get to the action faster, we’ve added a 'Quick-start' option to Verzik in normal and hard mode versions of ToB.




Once you’ve faced her at least once, you’ll be able to right-click and jump straight into the fight, skipping the chatter.




Note, this option isn’t available in Entry Mode. We wouldn’t want to rob new players of their first introduction to Verzik’s… charming personality.

Rune Pouch Loadout Expansion


Your Rune Pouch just got a new look! We’ve added six extra loadout slots, giving you a total of 10 to play with.




On top of that, you can now name your loadouts, so no more guessing whether 'Loadout 3' was your Inferno setup or ToB Mage build. Just pick from a handy list of preset names, slap them on your loadouts, and swap between them at a glance.

Fairy Ring Search Functionality


Fairy rings are now in flight on the offical client!




You can now search for destinations by name, making it far easier to find where you’re going without needing to memorise dozens of 3-letter codes. Just type, click, and you’re on your way.




We’ve also made the selector’s wheels spin much faster, so it won’t feel like turning an ancient rotary phone anymore.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





Finally, we’ve boosted your favourite slots from 4 to 10, giving you plenty of room to save all your most-used destinations.



S.T.A.S.Hing


Ever finished a clue step, tele’ed away, and realised you’re still rocking that mismatched clue outfit? We’ve all been there.




Now, things just got easier - STASH Units can accept items directly from your equipped slots. Once you’ve done the emote, just shove your clue gear straight back into its hidey-hole without the inventory juggling.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





This feature comes with a handy toggle in the settings menu. Leave it off if you prefer the classic method, or flick it on to let S.T.A.S.H units grab equipped gear as well as items from your inventory.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





Do note that withdrawing items still sends them to your inventory, so make sure you’ve got space when reclaiming them!



Combat Achievements: Remembered


Ever re-open your Combat Achievements tab only to sigh as it dumps you back at the overview, forcing you to hunt down the boss, task, or reward you were last checking? We feel that.




From now on, the interface will remember the last thing you were looking at, be it tasks, bosses, or rewards - complete with any filters you had applied. Open the tab, and you’re right back where you left off.




Not a fan? No worries! A toggle in the settings menu lets you disable this feature and stick with the classic 'overview first' behaviour.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!



Port Phasmatys: Streamlined Barrier


Post-Ghost Ahoy, the Port Phasmatys barrier now takes a single click to pass, merging Pass and Pay-toll - just one click and you’re through, with no more woo woo woo!





If you can’t see the image above, click here!



Chompy Hat Menu


Claiming your Chompy Hunting Hats just got a whole lot easier. Rantz now has a simple interface for picking up or reclaiming hats you’ve unlocked with your chompy kills, so no more juggling dialogue boxes!





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





You can now store all your Chompy Hunting Hats in the Armour case in your Player-owned house's Costume room, keeping your collection organised and ready to show off.





If you can’t see the image above, click here!





Simply complete the Big Chompy Bird Hunting quest and unlock hats through your kills, then speak to Rantz to view, claim, and manage your collection - all from one tidy interface!



Chambers of Xeric rewards chest


Claiming your Chambers loot just got easier! The rewards chest now includes a 'Bank all' button, letting you send your hard-earned rewards straight to your bank in a single click.

Sunfire Splinters at Doom




We need to talk about splinters, and not the kind you get from playing with wood...




Since Dooms' release, we've noticed that the value of Sunfire splinters has decreased significantly.




Although the splinters gained per player at Doom are fairly modest (around 400 an hour), the sheer number of players engaging with Doom for its uniques has led to millions entering the game passively. This has had a significant impact on their value, and on other pieces of content, such as the Colosseum, where splinters play a major role.




As such, we're removing Sunfire Splinters from Doom's loot table with today's game update.




We know splinters are an important resource, and we want them to remain valuable and rewarding to earn. However, it's clear that they can't come passively from another highly engaged activity. Instead, we see potential for a future activity designed specifically around splinter acquisition, one that provides a healthy, sustainable supply without overwhelming their value.




We understand that this decision may disappoint some of you, but please know it has been made with the long-term health of the game in mind. Doom should be about chasing its uniques, while the Colosseum should remain a rewarding and valuable endgame activity. By removing splinters from Doom, we're protecting the Colosseum's integrity and ensuring its rewards remain worthwhile in the long run, without being unintentionally undermined.

Other Changes


Trading Restrictions in PvP



Some sneaky players were using alternate accounts to 'deliver' food and potions mid-fight, cutting out a lot of the risk that makes PvP thrilling. That’s no longer possible:

If you’ve been in combat with another player within the last 15 ticks in the Wilderness, Deadman, or PvP worlds, you can’t pick up food or potions that are on the floor.
If you’ve been in combat with another player within the last 20 ticks in Deadman or PvP worlds, you can’t trade either.
Multi-combat zones are unaffected, so group fights can carry on as usual.

Risk is what makes these worlds exciting, and we hope these changes will keep fights fairer and more intense!




Finally, a few more improvements and fixes to cover:

Guardians of the Rift enjoyers should now find that the entrance barrier can only be locked on non-GOTR-themed worlds. Previously, the list of worlds was inaccurate, and one world was missed.
Joining Blood Moon mid-Jaguar phase will now correctly show the right Jaguar's safety circle straight away, instead of briefly displaying the wrong one. *Edit, this has unfortunately been reversed while the team investigates an issue. Apologies.
The Virtus set now has its set bonus for Ancient magicks displayed.
Fixed an issue where completing 'Enter the Abyss' incorrectly allowed players to receive Abyssal Demon Slayer tasks without Priest in Peril or Fairy Tale Part II.
Slayer masters will now respect your combat level (if enabled) even with a Slayer cape equipped.
Players can now speak to any Slayer master to cancel a task for free that is not possible to complete based on quest requirements or Slayer level, in case you received a task you were ineligible for in the prior weeks.
The weeds in the Morytania herb patch have been restored to their proper dark green colour, matching the rest of the region's gloomy vegetation.
Hovering over the world map icon on desktop (with tooltips enabled) now displays 'World Map' along with the desktop shortcut 'Ctrl+M'.
A rogue full stop has been spotted, rounded up, and removed! The level 93 Meiyerditch shortcut in the Agility guide is now punctuation-consistent.
Buying a piece of the Tithe Farm outfit no longer causes the Collection Log to increment the item's counter by 2.
