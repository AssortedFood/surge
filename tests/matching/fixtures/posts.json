    "content": "Our friends on the RS3 team have launched their first League, CATALYST. Here's what you ought to know.\n\n\n\n\n\nOUT NOW RuneScape: Leagues: CATALYST (RS3)\n\n\nWhat is RuneScape: Leagues: CATALYST?\n\n\n\nIf you've played any of the five OSRS Leagues then you'll be familiar with the concept, but here's the gist of how it'll work in RS3. Alternatively, check out the official Launch blog or the What Is Leagues blog (RS3) for even more detail.\n\n\n\n\nLeagues is a time-limited game mode that lets you start fresh on an alternate version of your character and relive your journey through Gielinor. CATALYST will run from September 15th until November 10th. This is available to all Members (RS3 and OSRS, since membership is shared across characters), with no microtransactions.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the RuneScape you know experienced through a new lens - with sky-high XP rates, game-changing relics, a unique set of tasks to conquer - making your adventure more intense than ever. Before long, you’ll be blazing through levels, toppling the toughest bosses, and unleashing epic game changing powers as you tear through your task list.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaying CATALYST League\n\n\n\nThere's all sorts of reasons why you might want to play CATALYST: you're desperate to scratch the Leagues itch, you're curious about skills like Archaeology, Invention, or Necromancy, or you might want to try challenging end-game PvM encounters like fighting Zamorak (Yes, you can fight Zamorak!), the Arch-Glacor, or Vorago.\n\n\n\n\nWe have the basics of how you can play here but we have to recommend checking out this incredible guide from TheRSGuy. It covers set-up of interfaces, explains combat differences, and even has a Leagues Hub with a Day 1 guide for those of you who find joy in efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, the incredible Wiki team have worked their magic to bring you another amazing Leagues hub. It has an interactive task list and an overview of your Relic choices, and way more.\n\n\n\n\nPlaying CATALYST will be the easiest Task you come across, it takes no time at all to get stuck in.\n\nInstall the RuneScape (RS3) game client - if you're on the Jagex Launcher just navigate to the RS3 menu\nSelect the character you want to play with\nLaunch RuneScape (RS3) and from the World selection page choose the Leagues worlds filter and select your world of choice\nOn logging in you'll see a brief description of CATALYST and how the rewards process works - since you can’t play Leagues and the main game mode simultaneously on the same account, players can nominate which account should receive their Leagues rewards\nChoose your character's appearance\nPick an interface layout\nComplete the Leagues tutorial in-game and unlock your first Relic\nPlay CATALYST!\n\n\n\n\nOur friends on the RS3 team have also introduced a promotional Membership Package which spans the entire duration of the League. You can get 57 days of membership for a discounted price! Note that membership applies to your character in either RS3 or OSRS. This offer is available to purchase from today now until 22 September 2025 at 11:00am UTC. Both new and returning members can partake, including those who’ve bought membership with Bonds while the promotion is active but this offer will only appear on Desktop. You can find the deal here at this link, taking you to the Store page and prompting you to login to your game account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it from us! We wish the RuneScape team every success with their first League, and we hope you have fun if you decide to play!\n\n\n\n\nMods Abe, Abyss, Acorn, Ape, Arcane, Archie, Argo, Ash, Ayiza, BigRig, Blighted, Blossom, Boko, Bruno, Chilly, Criminal, Curse, Daizong, Donkey, Ed, Elena, Enigma, Entropi, Freddie, Fuzz, Gecko, Gengis, Gizmo, Goblin, Grace, Grub, Halo, Harold, Hend, Hornet, Husky, Ivory, Jalo, Jamesy, Jerv, Keyser, Kieren, Kirby, Kurotou, Leebleh, Lenny, Light, Liron, Lykos, Mack, Manked, Markos, Maylea, Mobius, Moogle, Morty, Moz, Necro, Nin, Nixon, Nox, Nylu, Ori, Other, Otter, Philomel, Pork, Pumpkin, Puppi, Rach, Redfield, Rice, Roq, Roy, Ry, Saiyan, Sarnie, Schmidt, Shogun, Shroom, Sigma, Skylark, Smithy, Sova, Spyro, Squid, Starry, Suharun, Surma, Sween, Tide, Titania, Titus, TJ, Tomb, Tsourorf, Tyran, Veda, Vegard, West, Wolfy & Yume\n\n\n\n\nThe Old School Team.",

    "title": "A Message about Real World Trading",
    "link": "https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/a-message-about-real-world-trading?oldschool=1",
    "content": "For as long as RuneScape has been around, a disappointing number of players have sought unfair advantages by buying in-game gold directly off illicit sellers.\n\nThis is called Real World Trading, and the game's rules expressly forbid it:\n\nReal World Trading\n\nReal World trading (RWT) means buying or selling in the real world, for real money or in exchange for anything of value, things that relate to Jagex accounts. This includes:\n\nIn-game items\nIn-game Gold (GP)\nAccount names\n   \n\nIn addition, paying someone to play your account for you is covered by this rule.\n\n\n\n\nThis rule-breaking doesn't just affect the player who's buying the gold. It creates a financial incentive for people who don't care about the game to flood it with bots and throw-away accounts to gather gold to sell. So, when legitimate players gather items to sell on the GE, they'll earn less because the market's affected by botted resources, and playing alongside all the highly visible bots is infuriating!\n\nOur hard-working anti-cheat staff are being aided by analysts and other staff across Jagex to help them clamp down on the bots; that's addressing the supply-side. But we need to address the demand-side too, since the sellers only have an incentive to gather all this wealth because of those players who buy it off them.\n\nBuying gold off a real world trader is already very clearly against the rules, but historically we've treated the buyers more leniently than the sellers when issuing penalties for real world trading. As part of our clamp-down on those gold-farming bots and the harm they do to Old School RuneScape, we're now taking a harsher line against players caught buying gold from them. If you're buying your gold that way, please don't expect to get away with just a warning; our agents will issue bans, temporary or permanent depending on the situation, even for first offenses, as well as confiscating items from the offenders.\n\nThank you for reading - and thank you for supporting Gielinor and its legitimate players by abiding by the rules as you play!\n\nJagex Player Support",

Let's take a look at them!\n\n\n\nBridge Over Less Troubled Waters\n\n\nTired of that pesky broken bridge near Fenkenstrain’s Mausoleum mocking you? Well, now you can actually repair it! All it takes is 59 Construction, 12 teak planks, and 56 nails. Once built, the shortcut requires 69 Agility to cross. This should make trips to and from the area far more convenient. Be warned, though - you'll find you need to repair both sides of the bridge before you can safely cross it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nFremennik Sea Boots\n\n\nThe teleports on the Fremennik Sea Boots now scale by Diary tier, making them more useful the further you progress. Teleports are now:\n\nTier 1 (Easy): 1 teleport per day\nTier 2 (Medium): 3 teleports per day\nTier 3 (Hard): 5 teleports per day\nTier 4 (Elite): Unlimited teleports\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nDesktop Shops Match Mobile\n\n\nShops on desktop now include the same quantity buttons that mobile players have enjoyed for some time. These let you set a preferred purchase or sell amount, and then buy or sell that amount with a single left-click. This should make shopping and skilling supplies much faster.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nThe Ropes are on Baxtorian Falls\n\n\nOnce you’ve completed both Waterfall Quest and the Kandarin Medium Diary, ropes will now be permanently secured at Baxtorian Falls. That means no more realising (after sprinting all the way there with 0 run energy left) that you left your rope in the bank, only to drift helplessly downstream in a puddle of soggy shame.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nHarmony Island Herb Patch\n\n\nThe herb patch on Harmony Island is now permanently free from disease. Any herbs planted there are guaranteed to remain healthy until harvest, providing a reliable location for your herb runs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nHunter Starter Pack\n\n\nAll Hunter Experts across Gielinor can now provide players with a one-time free Hunter Kit. This should make getting started with the skill a little easier, particularly for newer players looking to try out different Hunter tools. This applies across all experts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClient and Mobile Updates\n\n\n\n\nMobile players can now choose to display a mobile icon next to their character in the minimenu. It’s a handy way to let others know you might be a little slower to type back - though don’t worry, the icon will stay hidden in PvP areas like the Wilderness and Ferox Enclave.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nNot feeling it? You can always toggle this off in the settings menu!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve also heard your feedback about extending this feature to other areas, like Friends Chats and Clan systems. While we can’t deliver this right away, it’s on our radar, and we’ll be looking into ways to expand it in the future!\n\n\n\n\nA few other client and mobile updates this week also include:\n\nFixed visual flickering in various locations and NPCs when using the new renderer beta.\nFixed a bug where the 'Limit FPS' setting would be ignored when the game is out of focus (Desktop Official Client).\nThe Official Client’s AFK logout timer can now be set up to 30 minutes.\nFixed an issue on mobile which caused private chat messages and system messages to overlap the chat stone UI.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Changes\n\n\n\nHallowed Sepulchre chests now correctly drop stackable clue scrolls if you haven’t reached your clue cap.\nImpling jars now only show the warning that prevents you from opening the jar if you already have a clue or scrollbox of that type on you and you’ve reached your stackable clue cap.

Friday, 19th September\nTime? 16.00 - 17.00 BST (Mass at 15.45)\nWhere? World 522\n\n\nWhat to expect?\n\n\nBeautiful chaos. Piles of deaths, Olm's head almost certainly deciding to laser the entire raid at once, a few heroic clutches (probably accidental), and a tragically low number of purples.\n\n\n\n\nBut you can also expect plenty of laughs, some excellent stories, and that unique brand of mass-event madness that makes it all worth it. We're here for the fun - not the points (definitely not the points). Whether we walk away with loot (remember, scuffed = stuff) or just tales of chaos, we'll have a laugh together.\n\n\n\n\nNot keen to be burned alive by your entire team? No worries! You can still join in by spectating - Mod Rach will be streaming her POV so you can enjoy the carnage from the safety of your bank tab.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements? Nothing but a bit of Chambers knowledge, a pulse, and a willingness to die with grace would be beneficial.\n\n\n\n\nSo polish your pickaxes, forget your anti-venom, and let's give Olm a show we won't forget - for better or for much, much worse!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPvP World Rota\n\n\n\n\nThe PvP rota has moved to Period A:\n\n539 - (US) - PvP World\n318 - (UK) - Bounty Hunter World\n548 - (Germany) - High-Risk PvP World\n577 - (US) - Free-to-Play PvP World\n559 - (UK) - LMS Competitive\n\n\n\nWorld 390 (AUS) for LMS Competitive has been activated with this rota.\n\n\n\n\nWorld 569 (AUS) for Bounty Hunter has been activated with this rota.\n\n\n\n\nThe PvP Arena is using '1 Def Pure' loadouts in Ranked Duels and Tournaments this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also discuss this update on the 2007Scape subreddit, the Steam forums, or the community-led OSRS Discord in the #gameupdate channel.

    "title": "Player Support Roadmap - September Check In",
    "link": "https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/player-support-roadmap---september-check-in?oldschool=1",
    "content": "Earlier this year, we revealed our Player Support Roadmap – a commitment to improving support services and anti-cheating systems throughout 2025. Today, we want to share an update on progress so far, what’s next, and how this fits into the bigger future we’re building together.\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the video below or read on for the highlights!\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't see the video above, click here.\n\n\n\nA Roadmap Shaped By Your Feedback\n\n\n\nIf you can't see the image above, click here.\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Support is one of the areas you’ve told us matters most. That’s why we set out a clear roadmap shaped by your feedback, and why we’re now holding ourselves accountable with regular check-ins.\n\n\n\n\nSince the project began, we’ve surveyed thousands of RuneScape and Old School players, helping us refine our priorities. Here's some of the wins you’ve told us you value so far:\n\nClearer updates and transparency from the Jagex team\nImproved Contact Forms and the new My Requests feature to track tickets\nFeedback when you report cheating in-game\n\n\n\nAnd you’ve also told us where we still need to go further:\n\nRealtime live chat support remains the #1 request\nMore transparency and flexibility in ban appeals\nFaster support response times\nExpanded account recovery options\n\n\n\nWe’re already working on these areas, with major updates due later this year. We’ll be checking in again with another survey in October to get your read!\n\n\n\nPart of a Bigger Journey\n\n\n\nThese improvements are not happening in isolation. We have an ambitious vision to improve your end-to-end player experience, alongside a greater focus on integrity and fairness across our games.\n\n\n\n\nBy improving how we support you day to day, we’re laying the foundation for everything else to come in 2026 and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Our Players\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Support is an area you’ve long asked us to improve, and our Roadmap was built around your most consistently mentioned features or expectations for what good looks like.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our commitment to transparency and ongoing improvements, we promised to gather feedback after major releases. Your input helps us stay accountable and makes sure we’re building the experience that matters most to you!\n\n\n\n\nFollowing our survey in December that informed our entire project, we ran a post Roadmap survey in May 2025. We received over 5,000 responses, from a variety of active and lapsed players from both RuneScape and Old School.\n\n\n\n\nThere were some great things to hear we’re doing well! Some of the key highlights:\n\nMany players appreciated clearer updates from Jagex regarding our roadmap and future plans.\nThe revamp of our Contact Forms and the new My Requests feature, which lets players view current and previous tickets on our Support Centre, were seen as helpful improvements.\nThe majority of players appreciated the new functionality that provides feedback to in-game cheating reports.\n\n\n\nThere were also some important improvements you want to see from us, all of which have even between recently released or are planned in our Roadmap for the rest of the year.\n\nReal-time live chat support remains our most requested feature.\nThere was some clear frustration with the ban appeal process, with players wanting greater transparency and more flexible options for appeals.\nExtended waits for support responses remained a pain point.\nSome players asked for more flexible account recovery options if they’ve lost access to their account.\n\n\n\nWith some key releases on the horizon, we’ll be sending out another survey in October to check in with you – both on if you’re feeling the effects of these new releases, and to make sure we’re still prioritising what matters most!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Progress So Far\n\n\n\n\nIn the six months since we announced our Roadmap, we’re already seeing some great progress based on the features and updates that we’ve dropped so far.\n\n\n\nImproved Player Support Response Times\n\n\n\nWe have more than doubled the size of our Player Support Team as part of our efforts to reach our 48-hour response time commitment. While this has helped, we’re not there just yet – but we’re confident we’ll get there through our larger team and other Roadmap work.\n\n\n\nNew Chat Spam Model\n\n\n\nOur Chat Spam model launched late last year, keeping the airways clear for those proper conversations.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve been continuing to refine it over 2025, leading to 17,000 chat spam bans since it launched.\n\n\n\nShowing Reports Matter\n\n\n\nAlongside our complex detection models, player reports are a huge help for helping us identify bad actors. It’s important we show that these reports do often result in action!\n\n\n\n\nOur new Reporting system now notifies you if we’ve acted on any of your recent reports, so you can see your reports matter. To date, we’ve sent 700,000 right to player inboxes! A big thank you to everyone who uses this feature, it really helps.\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't see the image above, click here.\n\n\n\nSingle Point of Contact Phase 1: Single Location Tracking\n\n\n\nWe’ve launched a new system that makes it easy to open a ticket with our Player Support team, and for Jagex Accounts; track its progress all in one location. We call this our Single Point of Contact service!\n\n\n\nSingle Point of Contact Phase 2: Scaper\n\n\n\nOur AI assistant Scaper launched last month, helping players find answers to questions they may not need a ticket to resolve. While Scaper will help plenty of requests, we’ll always let you skip the AI chit chat and open a chat or ticket with a real person if you’d prefer.\n\n\n\n\nScaper has handled over 22,000 player chats so far, with a satisfaction score of 70%. Over the next year we’ll start to explore ways for Scaper to handle self-service directly in the chat so you can instantly resolve certain support requests without the wait!\n\n\n\nStrengthening Actions Against Bots\n\n\n\nSince our last update, we’ve continued to strike at Botting with mass removals of accounts linked to Botters.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve also made our penalties for Real World Trading significantly harsher as a deterrence for players buying gold, with a goal of reducing RWT Gold demand and the value of Botting within our games, and continue to develop further detection and removal capability.\n\n\n\nImproved Ban Appeal Process\n\n\n\nMost bans and mutes can be avoided by following the rules and Terms & Conditions, but if something does go wrong, we want you to feel confident that we’ll listen and review things fairly.\n\n\n\n\nIn our survey back in December 2024, 77% of players who appealed a ban or mute were unsatisfied with the experience. That’s why, on September 15th, we made some big improvements to our offence appeal process, with more human involvement and clearer communication.\n\n\n\n\nHow It Works\n\nFirst appeal: Submit your appeal and a Jagex Moderator will review it, checking account ownership, looking closely at all available evidence, and removing offences caused by hijackers or applied incorrectly.\nClear explanations: If your appeal is denied, we’ll email you a more detailed explanation of the decision.\nSecond appeal: If you still believe the outcome is wrong, you can appeal again for a second review, following the same process.\n\n\n\nEven past offences under 6 years old that were previously denied can be appealed again under the new system. We are unable to review bans over 6 years old due to legal requirements to delete those accounts under Data Privacy Laws and retention policies.\n\n\n\n\nEvery appeal is reviewed by a real person, with evidence carefully checked in two stages. While our error rate is very low, we know mistakes can happen and we’re committed to fixing them when they do. Real world trading offences have already been thoroughly checked prior to being applied, as such these appeals will only be reviewed once more.\n\n\n\nImproved Security Defaults & Education\n\n\n\nIn our last update, we mentioned that adoption of Jagex Account security features was lower than we’d like.\n\n\n\n\nSince then, we’ve been working to raise awareness with additional education and recommended changes throughout our account processes.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve also disabled automatically disabling email authentication when you add another form of 2FA, providing more flexibility in how you authenticate your account.\n\n\n\n\nThe result of these changes has been an increase in players enabling extra security measures, which is great to see!\n\n\n\n\nRemember: relying only on email codes leaves your account vulnerable if your email is ever compromised. Make sure your email is secure and add extra protections through your Jagex Account for peace of mind.\n\n\n\nLauncher Logout Extension\n\n\n\nSometimes small changes can really help. We recently extended the inactivity of the log out timer on the Jagex launcher from 30 days to 90 days.\n\n\n\n\nThis extension means a better experience if you step away for a while but also reduces the chance of you needing to go through recovery if your old password eludes you. We hope it doesn’t, but it happens!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPillar 1: Support Experience\n\n\n\n\nThe first pillar of our plans is all about providing a simple, effective and fast support experiences to you.\n\n\n\nLive Chat Is Almost Here!\n\n\n\nThis long-requested feature is about to be real. We’re just weeks away from delivering Live Chat during peak hours with real Mods in Player Support!\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure we have an opportunity to learn and refine our processes, we’ll initially soft launch Live Chat soon for payment related tickets only. We’ll then begin rolling out chat for accounts management and technical help over the following month, aiming to have completed a full rollout by the end of October!\n\n\n\n48 Hour Ticket Response Time\n\n\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, our team has more than doubled! Our Respone Times are trending down, and alongside other improvements, we aim to hit 48 Hour average ticket response time by the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen ticket satisfaction scores increase from 60% to 79% this year as a result of the changes we’ve already made, and we’ll continue to improve your experience, and aim to increase CSAT to consistently over the gold standard of 80%.\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't see the image above, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPillar 2: Account Issues & Security\n\n\n\n\nThe second pillar of our plans are all about keeping your accounts safe and giving you greater control.\n\n\n\nHijacking Protection\n\n\n\nIn the Dec 2024 survey, 87% of players wanted Jagex to lock their account if hijacked so they can recover it.\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, we’re developing a new detection model designed to identify when an account may have been hijacked. At first, this system will notify players via email when suspicious activity is detected. Soon, it will go further by locking accounts to kick out hijackers.\n\n\n\n\nTo support this, we’ve improved the “End all sessions” function. Previously, ending sessions would log you out of websites but wouldn’t remove your character from the game instantly.\n\n\n\n\nNow, when you hit End all sessions in your account settings, your character is immediately logged out of RuneScape, Old School RuneScape, the Launcher and our Website.\n\n\n\n\nFrom there, you’ll need to re-authenticate before getting back into the game, ensuring that only you can regain access.\n\n\n\nLauncher Security Updates\n\n\n\nWe’ll be releasing a brand-new Security tab in the Jagex Launcher. If your account is missing important protections, such as a TOTP authenticator app or backup codes, this tab will pop up to encourage you to secure your account.\n\n\n\nAccount Recovery\n\n\n\nFinally, we know account recovery is one of the most critical aspects of Player Support. We’re currently designing a smoother, more secure recovery process to help you get back into your account safely if the worst happens.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a complex piece of work, so we want to make sure we get it right. Expect to hear more in future roadmap updates.\n\n\n\nJagex Account Pain Points\n\n\n\nWe’ve been working on addressing Jagex Account pain points across multiple areas and platforms based on your feedback.\n\n\n\n\nMobile Character Switching is on the way, due to be released before the end of this year.\n\n\n\n\nWe're also still on track to improve the elevated permissions issue by the end of this year. Players should see an improvement to installing the Launcher on devices without admin access for RuneScape and Old School via RuneLite. This will help you install some of our clients on public computers, such as in the library or workplace, for those extra XP gains!\n\n\n\n\nWe continue to invest in ensuring our games are accessible for as many people to play as possible. For our Linux players, we’re actively investigating bringing the Launcher to Linux platforms. While we don’t have any specific updates today, it’s still on our radar.\n\n\n\n\nThere are also planned improvements on Mac. We’re committed to ensuring Mac players aren’t impacted by the upcoming deprecation of Rossetta 2 in coming years. For those users playing on Apple Silicon Mac devices, we will be providing a native build of the Launcher and games that supports this architecture, in ample time of the deprecation.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll also be improving your experience by giving flexibility to change the behaviour of various aspects of the Launcher, first being the close button, coming soon.\n\n\n\nJagex Launcher & Account Reliability\n\n\n\nIn our December 2024 survey, around half of Legacy account players said they were hesitant to switch because they’d seen Jagex Account users run into Launcher login issues.\n\n\n\n\nSince then, we’ve rolled out optimisations that make the Launcher run smoother and more reliably during those busy spikes around big updates. We’re pleased to report there were no performance issues during significant launches – like the Varlamore update in July or the RuneScape Leagues launch on September 15th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPillar 3: Cheating Detection & Removal\n\n\n\n\nOur third pillar is about keeping the game fair for everyone.\n\n\n\n\nWe know dealing with Bots and Cheaters is of huge importance to the community – and it is to us too. There’s been huge amount of time and effort put into this area over the past few months, and we are far from done.\n\n\n\nNew Bot Detection Models\n\n\n\nWhile we can’t go into details on this one to avoid tipping off Botters, we are investing in our technology and detection methods to better identify and flag Bot accounts to be banned.\n\n\n\nReal World Trading\n\n\n\nTo further deter Botters, we’re also improving our ability to tackle likely Real World Trading – and in combination with our harsher penalties, ensure we continue to deter both buyers and sellers of RWT gold as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Next Updates\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Support matters, and we know it’s something you’ve long wanted to see improved.\n\n\n\n\nWe want you to feel the effects of all these improvements across a ton of areas, and we know some of your most desired features are still to come – like better cheating detection, Live Chat for all tickets, and more flexibility in Account Recovery.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s plenty still ahead of us to deliver on, and we’ll keep you updated every step of the way. Expect further news in the coming months as these features go live!\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your continued support and feedback along this journey. See you in Gielinor.\n\n\n\n\n\nJagex Player Support",

Let's take a look!\n\n\n\nChugging Barrel Improvements\n\n\nTired of jumping back and forth between your Bank and Potion Storage just to top up your Chugging Barrel? We hear you. Now, when you hit the 'Load' button, your barrel can snatch potions from both your Bank and Potion Storage at the same time - no interface gymnastics required.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s even a new bank setting so you can decide whether your barrel raids both storages or just the one you’ve got open. To keep things crystal clear, chat messages will tell you exactly how many doses came from each spot - so more potions, less clicking!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nMulti Cannon\n\n\nEver wish you could load your Dwarven Multicannon with just the right number of cannonballs without wasting a single one? Now you can! The new 'Load-X' option lets you pick exactly how many cannonballs to feed your cannon, so you can go full-on siege mode, or just tickle a few mobs. Handy in spots where you place a cannon to pull in agression, but are otherwise barraging down stacks - such as Smoke Devils.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to change your default load? No problem - the amount can be customised right in the settings menu. Boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nBarrows Prayer\n\n\nNothing ruins a Barrows run faster than not noticing your Prayer getting sapped by those spooky brothers. To save you from accidentally running dry, we’ve added a chat message that pops up whenever your Prayer is drained - right alongside the classic floating face effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s crystal clear when your Prayer’s taking a hit, so you can react faster and keep that HP from falling.\n\n\n\nBank All Your Shame at ToB\n\n\nDying in the Theatre of Blood is never fun, but reclaiming your loot just got a little less soul-crushing. The ToB death chest now has a Bank all button.\n\n\n\n\nSimply unlock your chest, hit the button, and all items will be sent straight to your bank in one click. Perfect for when you want to rage quit with feeling.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nBirdhouse Seed Warning\n\n\nAccidentally chucking high-value seeds into your Fossil Island birdhouses? Ouch. To save your GP from flying away, we’ve added a toggleable warning when depositing seeds above a value you choose. Head into the settings menu to turn the warning on and set your personal threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you try to plonk in a pricey seed, a friendly chat message will pop up, making sure you’re really, really sure before you commit.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow your birdhouses can stay full without your bank taking a hit!\n\n\n\nSee Every Bonus, Big or Small\n\n\nEver worn a piece of Inquisitor’s armour and wondered if that tiny 0.5% damage and accuracy boost was really doing anything? Or if your Graceful boots were actually helping with run energy? We’ve fixed that.\n\n\n\n\nThe Set Effects menu now shows the bonuses from each individual piece of an outfit, as well as the full set bonus if you’ve got the whole thing equipped. Whether you’re rocking partial Inquisitor’s, Graceful, or one of the many skilling or combat outfits with tiered bonuses, you can now see exactly what each piece is contributing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo more guessing - your stats window now tells the whole story. Equip your gear, check your boosts, and feel smug about every little bonus you earn.\n\n\n\nSuggested Worlds Made Clickable\n\n\nTired of manually switching worlds for your favourite minigames? Now, on the Grouping tab, the suggested world for each activity is a clickable button.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nClick it, confirm the prompt, and you’re in the recommended world without any extra fiddling. Whether you’re heading to Fishing Trawler, Barbarian Assault, or any other activity with a suggested world, hop to it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Changes\n\n\n\nFire and Infernal capes will now keep their fiery textures when teleporting, instead of briefly swapping to a static version.\nFixed the Slayer cape perk so players can now get back-to-back Zuk tasks as intended.\nFixed some blocked ground near Taverley that was stopping players from walking through.\nThe four bandana eyepatches can now be used for a clue that requires a bandana.\nBandana eyepatches once again have the correct colour inventory icon.\nThe ring of stone, and similar items, no longer break you out of being tethered to scenery at Tempoross.\nThe new icon that denotes mobile users is now automatically hidden in the Bounty Hunter lobby area.\n\n\n\n\n\nPvP World Rota\n\n\n\n\nPSA: We’re aware that the Bounty Hunter worlds did not rotate as expected this week. Apologies for the mix-up! They will revert to their correct rotation in next week’s update, switching over to the expected Rotation B.\n\n\n\n\nThe PvP rota has moved to Period A:\n\n539 - (US) - PvP World\n318 - (UK) - Bounty Hunter World\n548 - (Germany) - High-Risk PvP World\n577 - (US) - Free-to-Play PvP World\n559 - (UK) - LMS Competitive\n\n\n\nWorld 390 (AUS) for LMS Competitive has been activated with this rota.\n\n\n\n\nWorld 569 (AUS) for Bounty Hunter has been activated with this rota.\n\n\n\n\nThe PvP Arena is using '1 Def Pure' loadouts in Ranked Duels and Tournaments this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also discuss this update on the 2007Scape subreddit, the Steam forums, or the community-led OSRS Discord in the #gameupdate channel.

    "content": "Feedback Changes - 25th September\n\n\n\n\nThank you all so much for taking the time to read this blog. We're almost there! After carefully reviewing community feedback and the responses to our survey, here's what's changing before the poll goes live on the 29th September:\n\n\n\n\nAquanite Hopper\n\n\n\n\nThe Aquanite Hopper's second bolt effect caused confusion due to our wording within the blog. We'd like to clarify that the effect reduces the second bolt by 67% damage, accuracy and enchanted bolt chance, so it is only 33% as effective.\n\n\n\n\nWe've seen some community feedback to suggest this feels underpowered compared to the skill levels required to obtain it. To address that, we're lowering the slayer requirement for Aquanites down to level 78. However, we're not looking to increase its power further at present. The goal is for the Hopper to be a strong offhand option while using Crossbows until players get the Twisted Buckler. It's not an end-game item and shouldn't be as strong as one. Unfortunately, that means it probably won't drastically shift up the Ranged meta. We're not looking to make Crossbows more effective than higher tier weapons like the Bow of Faerdhinen, but it should be a reasonable option for mid-game accounts.\n\n\n\n\nHorn of Plenty\n\n\n\n\nPlayers have asked that we remove the upkeep cost from the Horn of Plenty. Originally, we proposed that it give a +4 invisible boost to your Hunter level when charged, doing nothing when uncharged. If we simply removed the upkeep cost, that +4 boost would affect all kinds of existing activities - Chinchompas, Molch pearls, Monkey tails, etc. - with no cost. We think that'd be a bit too much! Still, we do understand that upkeep costs can be annoying, so we'd like to propose that it give a +2 invisible buff when uncharged, increasing to +4 when you charge it with the Gryphon feathers.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we create a new loot tables, their value must come from an existing source in the game. For example, alchables come at the cost of inflation and PvM uniques come at the cost of other PvM uniques that they compete with. Rainbow crabs, for example, could have been added to the Gryphons' loot table, making it a profitable and desirable task. However, in doing so, it would have reduced the profitability of Rainbow Crab Hunting. The purpose of Gryphon feathers are to encouarge players to engage with both Slayer and Hunter, as opposed to another resource that would only encourage them to engage with Slayer.\n\n\n\n\nGleaming Rapier\n\n\n\n\nTo address concerns that the Gleaming Rapier is too easy to obtain for the power level that it's sitting at, we're adding a Level 70 Smithing requirement to create it (similar to the Zombie Axe). The item will drop in a tarnished state and you will need to polish it by using it on the polishing wheel in the Giant's Foundry. This means that Giant's Foundry will also be a Quest requirement for the Gleaming Rapier.\n\n\n\n\nWe hear your feedback regarding Rapiers being traditionally 4-tick weapons. To avoid confusion, we're pivoting the Gleaming Rapier away from the 'Rapier' weapon category by altering its model and name. Rest assured, its speed and stats will remain the same.\n\n\n\n\nLava Strykewyrms\n\n\n\n\nThere was an error in the blog regarding Strykewyrms being 'unlockable' tasks, which has now been corrected. They are, in fact, being proposed as part of Wyrm tasks, so they will not be unlockable. They are also single-way and not cannonable, similar to Aquanites. Apologies for the mix-up!\n\n\n\n\nFrost Dragons\n\nFrost Dragons will now be weak to crush instead of stab, as we liked the suggestion from players, considering they are made of ice!\n\n\n\n\nOn our Livestream Q&A, we addressed concerns about the loot table of Frost Dragons & Strykewyrms in a bit more detail, so go check that out!\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\nThere wasn't a clear winner in our survey for community consensus on what we should do with skill total worlds, so we'll put this to a poll and offer both options stated in the blog.\n\n\n\n\nWe'll change the spelling of 'Hemostatic' to 'Haemostatic' (the British way), because tea tastes better with more vowels.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we really love the community's suggestions regarding transmog options for pets! We're not able to commit to these for launch, however, we'll certainly keep them in mind for the future. For now, vote on the pet YOU want to see most!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the third and final Sailing content poll, covering new Slayer creatures and unique items found on new islands! Part of your adventures out at sea involve navigating dangerous waters. Those brave enough to venture deep into Gielinor's oceans will stumble upon exciting new areas with lucrative rewards. But be warned! These locations are extremely dangerous for unprepared sailors, with creatures unlike any you've seen before. We've saved the most exciting content poll for last, so prepare yourself...\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the Slayer-related rewards, it's worth noting that the islands you discover through Sailing will be home to a mix of both familiar and new creatures. Our aim is to bring these areas to life by populating them with wildlife that adds flavour and atmosphere, similar to the way we released content in Varlamore. Most of the flavour creatures will not be polled, as they don't offer any notable rewards or ties to Slayer. They are simply there to make the world feel richer and more alive.\n\n\n\n\nWant to see more? Check out this video by Scritic & Gnomonkey to learn all about it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the video above, click here to watch it!\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing: The Gryphons\n\n\n\nThese infographics were made in partnership with GentleTractor. If you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Conch is the ancestral homeland of the Tortugan race, however, it has been surrounded and inhabited by the Gryphons for centuries. To a Gryphon, Tortugans are no more than their next meal. These terrifying beasts regularly scout the skies and shores for isolated targets, often baby Tortugans who don't know how to protect themselves. While it's rare for humans to be nearby, they won't taste any different to a hungry Gryphon!\n\n\n\n\nYou will meet these fantastical apex predators through the Tortugan Questline. They attack with Melee and are particularly weak to Magic (especially air spells), but Melee will also be a viable way to take them down. They will have a special mechanic where, if a player's total weight is too low, the Gryphon will knock them back, dealing unavoidable damage. They have a few more tricks up their claws as well, and you'll need to think carefully about how to avoid their attacks. We won't spoil the details just yet… but let's just say the Tortugans might have a trick or two worth borrowing.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nWe're looking to make them their very own unlockable Slayer task, and yes, there's a superior version! This tougher version won't go down easily! Gryphons and their superior variants can be found in single and multi-combat areas and are also cannonable!\n\n\n\n\nWe appreciate that players might be concerned about Sailing's impact on the existing Slayer meta. We've carefully balanced all of the new Slayer tasks included within this blog to ensure that the new additions to Slayer feel new and exciting, but they won't shake up the current status quo too much. In the survey linked below, we'll be asking the community how you feel about these tasks. Please rest assured, we're willing to make adjustments based on community concerns. You can let us know how you feel about these tasks (weightings & quantities) in the survey linked at the bottom of the blog. Be sure to tell us if you would like us to make adjustments before we poll this content!\n\n\n\nCreature\tSlayer Unlock Requirements\tQuantities\tWeightings\tSlayer Point Unlock\nGryphons\t\n51 Slayer\nTroubled Tortugans (45 Sailing required)\n60 Combat (only relevant if your settings filter tasks by combat level)\n\t\nVannaka: 30 - 80\nChaeldar: 60 - 100\nNieve: 110 - 170\nDuradel: 100 - 210\n\t\nVannaka: 5\nChaeldar: 5\nNieve: 7\nDuradel: 7\n\t\nWings Spread - Allows Nieve and Duradel to assign Gryphon tasks. Costs 80 Slayer Points.\n\nUnique Drops\n\nGryphon Feathers\n\n\nAll gryphon variants will drop Gryphon Feathers. They're tradeable items specifically used to charge a new unique item, the Horn of Plenty.\n\n\nHorn of Plenty\n\n\nIf you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nThe Horn of Plenty is a new tradeable Hunter item, equipped in the off-hand slot and requiring level 50 Hunter. When equipped - and charged with Gryphon Feathers - it provides an invisible +4 boost to your Hunter level. When uncharged and equipped, this boost will be +2 Hunter instead. While the Horn is equipped, it consumes a charge every 1/25 Hunter catches. Additionally, you can toggle it on to give a 1/10 chance to double a Hunter catch. If you successfully double a Hunter catch, it will consume an additional Gryphon Feather, but this extra catch does not grant additional XP.\n\n\n\n\nYou can only obtain the Horn of Plenty as a drop from regular Gryphons or their superior versions.\n\n\n\n\nDev Comment: With the Horn of Plenty, we wanted to explore using the off-hand slot for a meaningful skilling purpose, since it's pretty under-utilised for skilling in particular. Skilling rewards from PvM are also relatively rare, and we felt it was a great opportunity to bridge that gap. Traditionally, PvM has often acted as a way to bypass skilling by pumping large amounts of resources into the game. This time, we want to flip that idea on its head by using a PvM encounter to create an item that directly enhances a skill. By doing so, we hope to make Gryphons feel like a more natural addition to the game. Hunter in particular can sometimes feel like it has long stretches where new levels don't unlock much value. The invisible Hunter boost improves your success rate, making those activities feel a bit more rewarding. Meanwhile, the chance to double your catches provides a nice extra benefit, reinforcing our goal of getting PvM to support skilling content.\n\n\n\n\n\nShellbane Gryphon (Boss)\n\n\n\nThese infographics were made in partnership with GentleTractor. If you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nThe Shellbane Gryphon is a brand-new, mid-level Slayer boss. It can also only be fought while on a Slayer task. At just 51 Slayer, it will be the lowest-level Slayer boss in the game. We think it can help give players a taste of Slayer bosses and their unique mechanics much earlier than currently available. Just remember, it's a solo-instance fight!\n\n\n\n\nLike normal Gryphons, the Shellbane Gryphon is weak to magic, but melee will also be able to defeat it. It primarily attacks with melee, but has a ranged attack it can use, too.\n\n\n\n\nWhile it shares traits and mechanics with regular and superior Gryphons, the Shellbane Gryphon brings a few nasty surprises of its own. Its wings are capable of generating immense power, so this battle's sure to be anything but a breeze! Pay very close attention to where you're standing. If that isn't challenging enough, its salivary glands are capable of delivering corrosive spit. Keep your skin covered, preferably with something tanky. Let's just say that sunburn is going to be the least of your worries on the Great Conch.\n\n\nUnique Drops\n\nGleaming Rapier\n\n\nIf you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nThe Gleaming Rapier is a new tradeable melee weapon, requiring 65 Attack to equip. It has the following stats:\n\n100 Stab Attack\n78 Slash Attack\n-3 Crush Attack\n15 Slash Defence\n20 Stab Defence\n-9 Crush Defence\n102 Strength Bonus\n5 Attack Speed\n\nEssentially, the Gleaming Rapier is the stab equivalent of the Zombie Axe, sitting between the Dragon Sword and the Zamorakian Hasta as a new mid-level stab weapon.\n\n\n\n\nYou can only obtain this as a drop from the Shellbane Gryphon.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing player feedback, the item will drop in a tarnished state and you will need to polish it by using it on the polishing wheel in the Giant's Foundry. This is locked behind a 70 Smithing requirement, and completion of Giant's Foundry. Additionally, we will be pivoting the Gleaming Rapier away from the 'Rapier' weapon category by altering its model and name. Rest assured, its speed and stats will remain the same.\n\n\n\n\nDev Comment: Stab options can feel limited in the mid-game with the Tier 60 Dragon Sword being the only option until you get a Zamorakian Hasta, or the coveted Osmumten's Fang. We expect this to hold a similar spot in the game to the Zombie Axe as a Tier 65 stab alternative which could see use for accounts fighting the Eclipse Moon or for accounts dipping their toes into Tombs of Amascut. While it competes with the Zamorakian Hasta in pure stab output, we believe the Hasta will still hold value as a flexible option, capable of all three styles, while still being valuable in the creation of the Dragon Hunter Lance, or when a 4-tick weapon is preferred.\n\n\nGryphon Pet\n\n\nThe Shellbane Gryphon will also have a pet. As we're looking to poll the general Sailing pet, we thought it's worth mentioning here in case you were wondering why a Gryphon isn't in the line-up!\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we add Gryphons and a superior variant as a new, unlockable Slayer task?\n\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we add the Shellbane Gryphon as a new Slayer boss?\n\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we add the Horn of Plenty as described in the blog? This would also include Gryphon Feathers used to charge the Horn of Plenty as a common drop from all Gryphon variants.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we add a 5-tick Tier 65 weapon as described in the blog?\n\n\n\n\n\nAquanites\n\n\n\nThese infographics were made in partnership with GentleTractor. If you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nAquanites are a creature some of you might be familiar with from RuneScape history. These amphibian horrors make their homes deep below the Western and Northern Oceans, preying on any creature unwitting enough to stray into the damp caves in which they dwell. One such set of caves can be found on the uninhabited island of Ynysdail near Gwenith. Any sailor able to reach the island will find great danger, but also the potential for great reward, if they dare to confront the Aquanites living there.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nThe Aquanites will be their very own, unlockable Slayer task. They have naturally high stats, but you'll be able to remove their advantages. We'll leave you to work out how! They also have superior variants, Elder Aquanites, with another unique special mechanic. We won't spoil too much, suffice to say they will test your ability to swap prayers consistently.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the Gryphons we talked about earlier, these creatures are found in singleway combat areas and are not cannonable.\n\n\n\nCreature\tSlayer Unlock Requirements\tQuantities\tWeightings\tSlayer Point Unlock\nAquanites\t\n78 Slayer\n73 Sailing\n80 Combat (only relevant if your settings filter tasks by combat level)\n\t\nNieve: 40 - 60\nDuradel: 30 - 50\n\t\nNieve: 5\nDuradel: 5\n\t\nLet's Stay All Aquanite - Increases the number of Aquanites assigned to 150 - 200.

This is a tradeable Ranged offhand that provides a 10% chance for Crossbows to fire twice instead of once. The second bolt will be reduced by 67% damage, accuracy, and enchanted bolt chance. Please note that the second bolt's Enchant effect cannot activate if the first bolt already activated it.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aquanite Hopper has the following stats:\n\n-5 Stab Attack, -3 Crush Attack, -5 Slash Attack\n-13 Magic Attack\n+12 Ranged Attack bonus\nNo defensive bonuses\n1 Ranged Strength bonus\n\n\n\nDev Comment: Currently, most Ranged off-hands have defence (such as shields) or modest accuracy. The Aquanite Hopper should add a noticeable increase to your damage output, opening up more options to use crossbows, particularly for mid-game accounts where the defensive capabilities of a shield aren't required, but it won't replace the Twisted Buckler as the existing best-in-slot Ranged option at the top-end.\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we add Aquanites and a superior variant as a new, unlockable Slayer task?\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we add the Aquanite Hopper as described in the blog?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLava Strykewyrms\n\n\n\nThese infographics were made in partnership with GentleTractor. If you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nDeep within the scorched heart of Charred Island lurk the Lava strykewyrms. Some claim they were born from violent eruptions long ago, while others suggest they are a less natural creation. The truth has long been lost, but some hints might still be found in the dungeon where they dwell. These monstrous creatures pose a constant danger, with larger ones burrowing beneath the ground, ready to erupt without warning and ambush any adventurer who dares to get too close!\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nLava strykewyrms are included under Wyrm tasks. They are relentless, and can attack with Melee or Ranged. Some of your Magic can weaken them, but other spells may only make them stronger! Even more terrifying is their superior version, the Magma strykewyrm. This ferocious beast can burrow underground, so you must be prepared to move quickly if you want to survive!\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, they will be found in singleway combat areas and cannons won't work on them.\n\n\n\nCreature\tSlayer Unlock Requirements\tQuantities\tWeightings\tSlayer Point Unlock\nLava strykewyrms (included under Wyrm tasks)\t\n62 Slayer\n60 Sailing\n70 Combat (if filtering by combat level)\n\t\nChaeldar: 40 - 60\nNieve: 40 - 60\nDuradel: 40 - 60\n\t\nChaeldar: 5\nNieve: 4\nDuradel: 4\n\t\nWyrm Regards - Increases the number of Wyrms assigned to 200 - 250.

If you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nIf you are an experienced Sailor, you may chart a course to Grimstone, a long-forgotten frozen island. Few who set foot here will ever return, for deep within its icy heart lie the Frost dragons. These ancient beasts are entombed in permafrost, their chilling breath seeping into the air. If you catch a glimpse of their shimmery scales, heed it as a warning and retreat, unless you're willing to take on a trial colder and deadlier than any other!\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nFrost dragons can be fought outside of Slayer tasks, but you can also get them as a Slayer task. Frost dragons won't need to be unlocked with slayer points, but are low-weighted tasks with low quantities added to higher level slayer masters. They attack with melee and dragonfire. They will be weaker to stab, heavy ranged and fire spells.\n\n\n\n\nTheir breath is icy rather than fiery, much like the King Black Dragon's ice breath attack. Like the new NPCs described above, they will be found in single-way combat areas and cannons won't work on them.\n\n\n\nCreature\tSlayer Unlock Requirements\tQuantities\tWeightings\nFrost Dragons\t\n87 Sailing\n85 Combat (if filtering by combat level)\n\t\nNieve: 30 - 40\nDuradel: 20 - 30\n\t\nNieve: 4\nDuradel: 4\n\nUnique Drops\n\nFrost Dragon Bones\n\n\nFrost Dragon Bones are a new type of bone that gives 100 Prayer XP when buried, putting them between Lava Dragon Bones and Hydra Bones.\n\n\n\n\nWhen blessing them and breaking them down, they give 84 Blessed Bone Shards.\n\n\nOther Drops\n\nDragon Sheet\n\n\nLike Lava strykewyrms, Frost dragons can also drop sheets of Dragon Metal that are used within shipbuilding.\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should Frost dragons be added as a new Slayer task?\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we add Frost Dragon Bones as described in the blog?\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Vote: Sailing Pet\n\n\n\nThese infographics were made in partnership with GentleTractor. If you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nAs promised, we would like to offer the community the opportunity to vote on what pet you'd like for Sailing. Without further ado, take a look at our options:\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a higher resolution look at the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Which option for the Sailing pet do you prefer?\n\n\n\n\nWe've seen suggestions for the Sailing pet to swim alongside your boat. It's a really fun idea! That said, we want the Sailing pet to feel like a traditional skilling pet, in line with the others already in game. This means we want you to be able to show it off anywhere, not just while you are out at sea.\n\n\n\n\nFor that reason, the pet is designed to follow you onto your boat rather than swimming around it. While we would love to explore swimming animations in the future, that won't be possible in time for launch. Instead, each option we've picked works both on land and at sea.\n\n\n\n\nThe current pet options are final, but we're still open to hearing your thoughts if there is anything you'd like us to refine. Ultimately, it's up to you to choose which one makes the cut, so let us know what you think!\n\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\n\nThis is our final Sailing poll until launch day, how exciting! With that in mind, we've added an extra section to this blog to catch miscellaneous topics or missed poll questions.\n\n\nJumbo Squid\n\n\nIn our last blog, we polled a series of new fish introduced with Sailing which have integration with both Cooking and Herblore. We included information about Jumbo Squids, but forgot to add the question into the final poll! Here it is:\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should Jumbo Squid be added to the game?\n\n\n\n\nSkill Total Worlds\n\n\nSkill Total worlds are special members-only worlds that require a minimum total level to enter. They don't change the content of the game, but they do offer perks to higher-level players, as they can train on less populated worlds.\n\n\n\n\nRight now, we have 1500, 1750, 2000, and 2200 worlds. The highest tier, 2200, is especially exclusive, usually only accessible to players with maxed or near-maxed accounts. However, when Sailing is added to the game, this will bring the maxed Skill Total to 2376. That naturally raises a question: what happens to Skill Total worlds?\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Raise the requirement of 2200 worlds\n\nWe could raise the requirement from 2200 to 2250, which spaces out a +250 level progression for Skill Total worlds (1500, 1750, 2000 and 2250).\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: Introduce a new Skill Total world\n\nWe could keep also add a new tier of Skill Total world, such as 2350.\n\n\n\n\nAs we didn't reach a clear consensus in the survey, we'll poll both options as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: When Sailing launches, should we change existing 2200 skill total worlds to be 2250?\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: When Sailing launches, should we add some 2350 skill total worlds?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank Space\n\n\nWe know that as new content arrives, more resources flood into the game and keeping that bank organised can almost feel like a part-time job! To help with that, we're delighted to confirm plans to increase the amount of bank storage available.\n\n\n\n\nHere's what we're proposing:\n\n+100 extra spaces for all members at no cost.\n+10 spaces per bank space unlock, raising the maximum unlockable slots from 360 to 450.\n\n\n\nSo maximum bank space will grow by +190 spaces in total.\n\n\n\n\nThis change should give you plenty of breathing room for any treasures you find out at sea!\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we increase bank space upon the launch of Sailing as described in the blog?\n\n\n\n\nMedallion of the Deep\n\n\nDuring your Sailing adventures, you'll have the chance to uncover hidden secrets. One such discovery is the Medallion of the Deep, an untradeable neck-slot item that functions as specialised diving equipment, letting you explore underwater without the need for additional gear. Please note, the Medallion of the Deep will not work in areas with a strict oxygen limit, for balancing reasons.\n\n\n\n\nWe want to preserve the excitement and mystery of this reward for launch, so we won't be detailing exactly how it's obtained - only that it's something to look forward to on your Sailing journey!\n\n\n\n\nDev Comment: We wanted the Medallion of the Deep to feel like a true reward for adventurers who enjoy exploration. Obtaining it will encourage players to seek out hidden content and embrace discovery throughout their journey to 99 Sailing.\n\n\n\n\nPoll Question: Should we introduce the Medallion of the Deep as an untradeable neck-slot item as described in the blog?\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Bleed Tonic\n\n\nIn our previous blog, we introduced and polled the 'Anti-Bleed Tonic'. After player feedback, we've renamed this item Haemostatic Dressing instead.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing discussions with the team, we'd like to alter the process of creating it slightly. All steps continue to use Herblore, and the effects of this item are unchanged.\n\nStep 1: Add Elkhorn to a vial to create an unfinished Elkhorn potion.\nStep 2: Mix in Squid Paste to make a Hemostatic Poultice.\nStep 3: Combine with Cotton Yarn to produce the final Hemostatic Dressing.\n\n\n\nHaemostatic Dressings will be made with 3 applications and can be decanted, like potions, to have up to 4 and they will still use the potion delay system when consumed. We're treating this like an honorary potion!\n\n\n\n\nMax Cape Clarification\n\n\nIn the Sailing Beta Blog, we explained that players will lose the ability to use the Max Cape when Sailing launches. This was met with a generally positive response from the community, but we didn't provide specifics on how exactly this would work, which brought up questions about whether players would have to re-purchase their cape. We'd like to offer some clarity and reassurance now.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Sailing launches, you will still own your Max Cape. However, it won't be equip-able until you've re-maxed. If you're wearing it when you next log in, it will be unequipped automatically, similar to how the Quest Cape works when you no longer meet its requirements!\n\n\n\n\nIf you own a cosmetic variant of the Max Cape (e.g the Infernal Max Cape), you will be able to dismantle it. Doing so will return both the base Max Cape and the item it was combined with to your inventory. You will not be able to recombine them or use the Max Cape until you've reached 99 Sailing and re-maxed your account.\n\n\n\n\nWe hope this approach clears up any confusion. It differs slightly from our original blog where we stated that the Max Cape would not return the base component. However, we are listening to your feedback and we'll keep listening!\n\n\n\n\n\nSailing Stress Test\n\n\n\nOn August 14th, we ran a large-scale Sailing load test to see how the game would hold up under the pressure of thousands of players joining all at once. We were looking to prepare for launch day by throwing our servers into a \"worst-case scenario\" by subjecting it to a far more intense load than what we actually expect, in order to see what broke, what held and what could be improved.\n\n\n\n\nWe're really heartened by how many players showed up, considering this wasn't a beta to show off new content. This test was purely for our own analysis, which in turn should make release day better for you all! Voluntarily wasting XP shows true dedication to the game and a willingness to help carve OSRS into the best thing it can be, so thank you for that.\n\n\nWhat Happened in the Test\n\n\nAt 2pm UTC, Thursday 14th of August, we started the first of multiple tests, restarting every half an hour. We announced it everywhere we could and asked as many of you to hop on at the same time as possible.\n\n\n\n\nOur test was targeted towards:\n\nPerformance and reliability of network code transmitting boat updates to everyone nearby.\nPerformance of boat movement and collision.\nPerformance of core sailing scripts.\nOverall server stability and memory usage.\nAny unexpected overhead that we may not have seen in our internal testing environment.\n\n\n\nTo really push things to their absolute limits, every player who logged in was automatically spawned onto a boat and told to sail laps around The Pandemonium (our best score was 47 seconds, shoutout Mod Nin). This world setup meant:\n\nThe world reached its 2000-player capacity.\nHundreds of boats were crammed into the same area.\nLots of movement was happening all at once.\nBoth player and boat scripts were running constantly in the background.\n\nAs the tests ran, we captured tonnes of metrics to tell us exactly how long the server was spending executing all of the different bits of code, and how that correlated to things like player count.\n\n\n\n\nIn short – absolute chaos. Perfect for testing, stressful for both the servers and us JMods!\n\n\nWhat We Learned\n\n\nThe good news is that most of our core systems worked as intended.\n\nBoat movement was very performant.\nNetwork code was acceptably performant, with some room for improvement particularly under heavy load.\nBoth player and boat scripts were acceptably performant.\nMemory wasn't a concern, staying well within normal ranges.\n\n\n\nWe did, unfortunately, experience one issue early in the test that caused major lag, with some game ticks taking upwards of 20 seconds! Upon inspection, we believe that this issue is a consequence of the way we run beta worlds, rather than Sailing code – but we will be investigating this further to make sure it doesn't happen again. Thankfully, this lag subsided after a few minutes and the test continued fairly smoothly!\n\n\n\n\nOverall, we are very pleased with the results here. Once the beta world lag subsided, Sailing was stable and playable, even on a full world with every single player Sailing – that's a heavier load than we can expect even on launch day! Our findings did reveal some problem areas though, both big and small. On the minor end of things, the performance of player and boat scripts were pretty good, but definitely stuck out in our performance graphs. A bit more pressing was the performance of our network visibility code, which decides what you can see, and builds packets of data to send to your client. This scaled fairly poorly with hundreds of boats all in the same area, but the test has revealed some optimisations we can make prior to launch.\n\n\nWhat This Means For Launch Day and What's Next For Sailing\n\n\nThe important takeaway is the stress test went as successfully as we could have hoped. Although we didn't achieve a lag-free test, the results of the data we got means we are confident that Sailing on launch shouldn't experience too many lag issues. But why?\n\nWe've now done this test, so have been able to directly target some of the biggest pain points.\nIt's unlikely that every single player in a world will be in boats at the same time.\nYou'll be spread all across Gielinor rather than clustered in one spot.\n\n\n\nWe're using this test to guide some improvements on the way to the launch:\n\nOptimising how the visibility system handles crowded areas.\nTightening up the performance of boat and player scripts.\n\n\n\nThe Sailing load test has given us confidence that we're on course for a smooth launch. Your feedback highlighted areas where we can further improve the experience, and we're deeply grateful for that. Many of you have also been asking whether we're still aiming for a late Autumn release. We are happy to confirm that development is on track and we'll be announcing the release date soon.\n\n\n\n\nThank you to everyone who joined in, shared the messages on socials, and kept us updated with how it was performing for you. Your participation gave us the data we needed, and it's helping us make sure Sailing launches in the best state it possibly can. We can't wait to set sail with you soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey\n\n\n\nThat's a wrap for today's blog! Let us know how you feel about the content in our survey linked below. We'll discuss feedback as a team and address it via a Twitch Sailing Q&A on Tuesday, September 23rd. If we need to make any changes to the design, we'll let you know about it ahead of the poll on Monday, September 29th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also discuss this update on the 2007Scape subreddit, the Steam forums, or the Sailing Discord.

Let's take a look!\n\n\n\nDesktop Minimap Toggle\n\n\nIf you’ve ever played OSRS on mobile, you’ll know the joy of tucking away the minimap to free up some precious screen space, especially handy when you’re trying to tap around a boss arena or keep your UI clean while skilling!\n\n\n\n\nWell, desktop players, it’s your turn! You can now right-click the world map icon and minimise your minimap just like on mobile. Your Hitpoints, Prayer, Run Energy, and Special Attack orbs will neatly stack up in the corner, leaving you with more breathing room to focus on the action. Just a heads up, this option is only available on the resizable layout.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nQuick-starting Verzik\n\n\nWe know the Theatre of Blood (ToB) is all about high stakes and sharp execution - not sitting through dialogue you’ve already heard a dozen times. To help you get to the action faster, we’ve added a 'Quick-start' option to Verzik in normal and hard mode versions of ToB.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve faced her at least once, you’ll be able to right-click and jump straight into the fight, skipping the chatter.\n\n\n\n\nNote, this option isn’t available in Entry Mode. We wouldn’t want to rob new players of their first introduction to Verzik’s… charming personality.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nRune Pouch Loadout Expansion\n\n\nYour Rune Pouch just got a new look! We’ve added six extra loadout slots, giving you a total of 10 to play with.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, you can now name your loadouts, so no more guessing whether 'Loadout 3' was your Inferno setup or ToB Mage build. Just pick from a handy list of preset names, slap them on your loadouts, and swap between them at a glance.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nFairy Ring Search Functionality\n\n\nFairy rings are now in flight on the offical client!\n\n\n\n\nYou can now search for destinations by name, making it far easier to find where you’re going without needing to memorise dozens of 3-letter codes. Just type, click, and you’re on your way.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve also made the selector’s wheels spin much faster, so it won’t feel like turning an ancient rotary phone anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we’ve boosted your favourite slots from 4 to 10, giving you plenty of room to save all your most-used destinations.\n\n\n\nS.T.A.S.Hing\n\n\nEver finished a clue step, tele’ed away, and realised you’re still rocking that mismatched clue outfit? We’ve all been there.\n\n\n\n\nNow, things just got easier - STASH Units can accept items directly from your equipped slots. Once you’ve done the emote, just shove your clue gear straight back into its hidey-hole without the inventory juggling.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis feature comes with a handy toggle in the settings menu. Leave it off if you prefer the classic method, or flick it on to let S.T.A.S.H units grab equipped gear as well as items from your inventory.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nDo note that withdrawing items still sends them to your inventory, so make sure you’ve got space when reclaiming them!\n\n\n\nCombat Achievements: Remembered\n\n\nEver re-open your Combat Achievements tab only to sigh as it dumps you back at the overview, forcing you to hunt down the boss, task, or reward you were last checking? We feel that.\n\n\n\n\nFrom now on, the interface will remember the last thing you were looking at, be it tasks, bosses, or rewards - complete with any filters you had applied. Open the tab, and you’re right back where you left off.\n\n\n\n\nNot a fan? No worries! A toggle in the settings menu lets you disable this feature and stick with the classic 'overview first' behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nPort Phasmatys: Streamlined Barrier\n\n\nPost-Ghost Ahoy, the Port Phasmatys barrier now takes a single click to pass, merging Pass and Pay-toll - just one click and you’re through, with no more woo woo woo!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\nChompy Hat Menu\n\n\nClaiming your Chompy Hunting Hats just got a whole lot easier. Rantz now has a simple interface for picking up or reclaiming hats you’ve unlocked with your chompy kills, so no more juggling dialogue boxes!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now store all your Chompy Hunting Hats in the Armour case in your Player-owned house's Costume room, keeping your collection organised and ready to show off.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply complete the Big Chompy Bird Hunting quest and unlock hats through your kills, then speak to Rantz to view, claim, and manage your collection - all from one tidy interface!\n\n\n\nChambers of Xeric rewards chest\n\n\nClaiming your Chambers loot just got easier! The rewards chest now includes a 'Bank all' button, letting you send your hard-earned rewards straight to your bank in a single click.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunfire Splinters at Doom\n\n\n\n\nWe need to talk about splinters, and not the kind you get from playing with wood...\n\n\n\n\nSince Dooms' release, we've noticed that the value of Sunfire splinters has decreased significantly.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the splinters gained per player at Doom are fairly modest (around 400 an hour), the sheer number of players engaging with Doom for its uniques has led to millions entering the game passively. This has had a significant impact on their value, and on other pieces of content, such as the Colosseum, where splinters play a major role.\n\n\n\n\nAs such, we're removing Sunfire Splinters from Doom's loot table with today's game update.\n\n\n\n\nWe know splinters are an important resource, and we want them to remain valuable and rewarding to earn. However, it's clear that they can't come passively from another highly engaged activity. Instead, we see potential for a future activity designed specifically around splinter acquisition, one that provides a healthy, sustainable supply without overwhelming their value.\n\n\n\n\nWe understand that this decision may disappoint some of you, but please know it has been made with the long-term health of the game in mind. Doom should be about chasing its uniques, while the Colosseum should remain a rewarding and valuable endgame activity. By removing splinters from Doom, we're protecting the Colosseum's integrity and ensuring its rewards remain worthwhile in the long run, without being unintentionally undermined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin the Halloween-related Challenges!\n\n\nPumpkin Carving Competition\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nSpooktober is officially here, and we’re kicking things off with an OSRS-themed jack-o-lantern carving contest, just the thing to get you in the Halloween spirit. Flex your IRL Crafting skill by carving a pumpkin with your best OSRS-inspired design and share it either at our dedicated channel on our Discord or under the dedicated Reddit post! Can’t get your hands on a pumpkin where you live? No problem, any fruit or vegetable will do! A terrifying turnip? A menacing mango? We stan them all!\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll be picking a winner in three categories:\n\nThe spookiest\nThe most creative\nThe funniest\n\nFor each winner, the following prizes are up for grabs:\n\n1 Slayer Enamel Mug\n1 Embroidered PK Skull Cap\n1 Baron Keyring\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetition is live now and runs until Monday, 13 October 2025 9am UTC. For more info, check out the T&Cs here.\n\n\n\nScapetober Challenge by RAC\n\n\n\nOctober 1st also means the return of the Scapetober challenge, hosted by the wonderful RuneScape Art Community! We love seeing the artwork you come up with for the Scapetober challenge every year, so we are dying to see what you'll share this time around!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, you can see this year's Scapetober calendar and daily prompts, with a twist this time! As always, you can daily draw and share something inspired by the prompt of the day. If you're unable to join the challenge every day for a month, you can choose among the orange prompts instead and share your drawings every 3 days for only 2 weeks. Where to share? Either in the dedicated channel on RAC Discord, or over on X using the #Scapetober hashtag. Looking forward to seeing your creations, they'll be such a treat!\n\n\n\nJMods Draw Your Halloween Suggestions\n\n\n\nWe're back with another JMods Draw, but this time it's Halloween edition! What would you like to see from OSRS with a Halloween twist? Get creative and share your suggestions to the dedicated channel on Discord! Mods West and Jerv will pick up from your suggestions and share their designs on an upcoming livestream - all inspired by you! Drop your spookified ideas, pumkin-ified concepts, cursed combinations and Halloween makeovers until 13 October 2025 9am UTC!\n\n\n\n\nLike all the previous JMods Draw sessions, this is purely for fun and for your Halloween pleasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerch\n\n\n\n\nTime is running out to get your hands on the latest official Old School RuneScape x Makeship plushies! Our cute critters range spans four iconic NPCs such as Zanik, Thurgo, Varrock Stray Dog and Varlamore Capybara.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t see the image above, click here!\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is only 1 week left to order these limited-edition plushies.\n\n\n\n\nYou have until October 4th 8:00am UTC, 4am ET, 1am PT and 6pm AET to purchase them on Makeship's website here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Changes\n\n\nTrading Restrictions in PvP\n\n\n\nSome sneaky players were using alternate accounts to 'deliver' food and potions mid-fight, cutting out a lot of the risk that makes PvP thrilling. That’s no longer possible:\n\nIf you’ve been in combat with another player within the last 15 ticks in the Wilderness, Deadman, or PvP worlds, you can’t pick up food or potions that are on the floor.\nIf you’ve been in combat with another player within the last 20 ticks in Deadman or PvP worlds, you can’t trade either.\nMulti-combat zones are unaffected, so group fights can carry on as usual.\n\nRisk is what makes these worlds exciting, and we hope these changes will keep fights fairer and more intense!\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a few more improvements and fixes to cover:\n\nGuardians of the Rift enjoyers should now find that the entrance barrier can only be locked on non-GOTR-themed worlds. Previously, the list of worlds was inaccurate, and one world was missed.\nJoining Blood Moon mid-Jaguar phase will now correctly show the right Jaguar's safety circle straight away, instead of briefly displaying the wrong one. *Edit, this has unfortunately been reversed while the team investigates an issue. Apologies.\nThe Virtus set now has its set bonus for Ancient magicks displayed.\nFixed an issue where completing 'Enter the Abyss' incorrectly allowed players to receive Abyssal Demon Slayer tasks without Priest in Peril or Fairy Tale Part II.\nSlayer masters will now respect your combat level (if enabled) even with a Slayer cape equipped.\nPlayers can now speak to any Slayer master to cancel a task for free that is not possible to complete based on quest requirements or Slayer level, in case you received a task you were ineligible for in the prior weeks.\nThe weeds in the Morytania herb patch have been restored to their proper dark green colour, matching the rest of the region's gloomy vegetation.\nHovering over the world map icon on desktop (with tooltips enabled) now displays 'World Map' along with the desktop shortcut 'Ctrl+M'.\nA rogue full stop has been spotted, rounded up, and removed! The level 93 Meiyerditch shortcut in the Agility guide is now punctuation-consistent.\nBuying a piece of the Tithe Farm outfit no longer causes the Collection Log to increment the item's counter by 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPvP World Rota\n\n\n\n\nThe PvP rota has moved to Period B:\n\n560 - (UK) - PvP World\n319 - (US) - Bounty Hunter World\n579 - (US) - High-Risk PvP World\n561 - (UK) - Free-to-Play PvP World\n580 - (US) - LMS Competitive\n\n\n\nWorld 390 (AUS) for LMS Competitive has been de-activated with this rota.\n\n\n\n\nWorld 569 (AUS) for Bounty Hunter has been de-activated with this rota.\n\n\n\n\nThe PvP Arena is using 'Zerker' loadouts in Ranked Duels and Tournaments this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also discuss this update on the 2007Scape subreddit, the Steam forums, or the community-led OSRS Discord in the #gameupdate channel.

    "content": "This Week's Update\n\nTo prepare for the launch of Grid Master on October 15th there will be no game update this week and instead, there will be reboot on Thursday 9th October for the standard changes to the PvP World Rota. Downtime will be minimal, just like a regular game update.\n\nUniversal\n(UTC)\tUK\n(BST)\tUS East\n(ET)\tUS West\n(PT)\tAustralia\n(AET)\n10:30am\t11:30am\t6:30am\t3:30am\t9:30pm\n\nWe recently released the times for when Grid Master goes live, but just in case you missed it in the Get Ready for Grid Master blog, we'll share them here too:\n\n\tTimer Begins\tWorlds Down\tWorlds Up\tGrid Master Live\nUniversal\n(UTC)\t8:45am\t9:30am\t10am\t11am\nUK\n(BST)\t9:45am\t10:30am\t11am\t12pm\nUS East\n(ET)\t4:45am\t5:30am\t6am\t7am\nUS West\n(PT)\t1:45am\t2:30am\t3am\t4am\nAustralia\n(AET)\t7:45pm\t8:30pm\t9pm\t10pm\nNew Worlds\n\nAlongside the reboot on Thursday, we'll also be adding 60 new worlds! These are being added in preparation for the full release and we'd like to test their performance ahead of time given it's such a high number of worlds being added at once!\n\nWe want to ensure that there are enough worlds for players to enjoy our very first community event, alongside those who want to continue progressing on the main game!\n\nImpacts On PvP\n\nWith these additional worlds, we know there are concerns around the Wilderness and PvP. More worlds means more hopping, fewer fights, and less fun.\n\nWe'd like to clarify that while these new worlds will launch as standard worlds (so we can monitor them ahead of the Grid Master launch to ensure stability), once Grid Master goes live, they will become exclusive to the event. Once the event ends, they'll be removed.\n\nBehind the scenes, we have begun early discussions around the impact that increasing the number of worlds has on player interactions within the Wilderness, and what we might be able to do to alleviate this. There's nothing concrete for us to share yet, but when we're ready we'll look to all of you to get your feedback!\n\nUpcoming Maintenance\n\nWe also want to let you know that on Tuesday 14th October there will be approximately a 3 hour period of maintenance to help ensure more robust and safer systems are in place for the launch. During this time, all worlds will be offline. This could also impact some other areas like the website.\n\n\tWork Begins (Approximately)\tWork Ends (Approximately)\nUniversal\n(UTC)\t8am\t11am\nUK\n(BST)\t9am\t12pm\nUS East\n(ET)\t4am\t7am\nUS West\n(PT)\t1am\t4am\nAustralia\n(AET)\t7pm\t10pm\n\nWe'll keep you updated through our Game Status Page and socials, so stay tuned for more updates there!\n\nYou can also discuss this update on the 2007Scape subreddit, the Steam forums, or the community-led OSRS Discord in the #gameupdate channel.

    "content": "With recent months seeing player number records broken week-after-week, it should come as no surprise that we're seeing a large cohort of players setting foot in Gielinor who've never played Old School RuneScape before.\n\nNot long ago, we released a handful of new player guides (now accessible from the main website, near the top-left) taking you through your initial setup and client selection, breaking down the Combat system, and helping you learn to set goals and complete them. Loads of you thought these were a great resource and we're excited to find even more ways to make this information more readily-accessible for new starters, but it's important that our commitment to helping more new starters stick around doesn't end there.\n\nThis blog is an overview of changes we'd like to make to smooth out the initial sections of gameplay. While it's true that Old School starts to get under your skin before long, it's also true that a significant chunk of prospective players bounce off before finishing Tutorial Island, gaining a level, or finishing a single quest.\n\nThe changes we're talking about in this blog aim to maintain the existing spirit of areas like Tutorial Island and Lumbridge, but better inform players and set them up for long-term success in Gielinor. Before the alarm bells start ringing, we're not going to be redesigning the tutorial or terraforming Lumbridge - these areas are iconic and we have no interest in trying to totally reinvent the wheel, we're here to fix a few spokes and improve the tyre pressure a tad.\n\nBefore we start listing off changes, we know you love your stats just as much as we do, so we thought we'd share some particularly eye-opening tidbits that we believe help demonstrate why changes to the first-time user experience (FTUE) could be very impactful!\n\nA sizeable chunk of players who start Old School for the first time never make it off of Tutorial Island, or log out for the final time before completing a single quest.\nPlayers who complete a quest are 1.5x more likely to stick around and become long-term members of the community.\nPlayers who complete a quest and gain a Combat level are 2x more likely to stick around and become long-term members of the community.\n\nOld School RuneScape relies overwhelmingly on players getting stuck in and continuing to play. Luckily for us, Old School's in a wonderful place right now and offers any prospective player with an unmatched breadth of content, goals to set, and progress to make that's never going to be invalidated, so we're seeing more and more new players trying out the game and getting properly stuck in!\n\nHaving said that, we think small changes in the right place could help players understand the tools available to them once they get into Gielinor, find their feet in a massive sandbox MMO, and ultimately stick around long-term once they realise what sets Old School RuneScape apart. New players shouldn't be struggling with using items in their inventory, or not knowing what Prayer is even for, or being able to note items at a bank, and that's what we're looking to improve.\n\nTo kick things off, we'll talk about changes that we're looking to make within the next few months. After that, we'll take you through some changes that we'd like to make in 2026 but would love to hear your thoughts on ahead of time.\n\nNew Player Improvements - Coming Soon\nTutorial Island\n\nFirst things first: don't panic! Tutorial Island isn't going anywhere, we're not reinventing the tutorial or moving it to another location because we know this island is sacrosanct: Vannaka's sass, cooking your first shrimp and having Newbie Melody blast out of your family computer's speakers late at night are just as important to us as they are to all of you.\n\nWe've got a lot of data on Tutorial Island, which we've used in conjunction with qualitative feedback from testers to identify the areas we believe could stand to be improved. Here are some highlights:\n\nThe most common 'drop-off' points (meaning parts of the tutorial where players get stuck and log out) are the following:\nAny scenario where the player needs to speak to the same NPC again, most often the Gielinor Guide, Quest Guide and Account Guide.\nAny scenario where players need to use items together in their inventory, namely lighting a fire or making bread dough.\nAny scenario that involves specific clicks within part of the UI, the two biggest examples here are equipping a sword and shield via the Equipped Items interface (something that no player is likely to do outside of Tutorial Island), and casting Wind Strike on a chicken.\nSome scenarios where players are expected to walk a longer distance, or use a ladder - the ladder in the Quest Guide's building is a standout here.\nThere's a lot of text on the UI, especially with the transparent 'Control Guide' textbox giving some guidance, while the typical message box is more specific. Additionally, the transparent textbox is on a timer and eventually goes away, and isn't consistently applied along the whole island.\nDialogue boxes combine bits of world-building, NPC dialogue and gameplay instructions in a way that can overload players and make it harder to discern what's expected of players.\nSome key features like right-clicking objects/NPCs are poorly explained or not explained at all.\nDefault settings could be tidied up considerably, visible roofs stands out as one that can impede a player's progress early-on.\n\nWhile it is true that some new starters are still likely to log out regardless of any changes we make here, we still believe there are a number of improvements we could make to better equip people for interacting with the sandbox that is Gielinor and start setting goals for themselves. Old School's 'click to interact with just about anything' approach isn't found in many other games, meaning some people struggle with the lack of transferrable skills from similar games - it's easy to jump from one FPS to another, but jumping from most MMOs to Old School is night and day!\n\nLet's take a look through some of the things we'd like to do and explain our reasoning as we go - it's important to us that we're all on the same page, so we'd welcome your thoughts on these and invite you to give us feedback or challenge us if you think we're missing the mark at all!\n\nAdd clearer visual cues to the NPCs you need to interact with, including when you need to interact with the same NPC for a second time. Currently, we're working towards a yellow outline, similar to the blue outlining that you'll see on the Official Client's Clue Scroll Helper.\nIn a similar vein, add an outline highlight to the objects that players are expected to interact with. Examples of this include doors, gates, trees to chop, a fire to cook your shrimp, the copper or tin ore for you to prospect - you get the picture!\nAdd some form of in-game highlighting system for UI components such as side stone buttons, spells or inventory items. This should make it clearer to players that they're supposed to click on the items in their inventory, a specific tab/side stone, or on the spell icon to finish the tutorial.\nImprove the 'Control Guide' functionality and text. This is the slightly transparent box with orange text that provides some instruction for navigating Tutorial Island.\nImprove clarity of dialogue boxes. Let these focus more on dialogue from NPCs while the Control Guide handles the 'out of world' stuff. Also, minimise these when they're not actively in-use.\n\nThis sort of 'outline signposting' functionality is used by countless players for quests, minigames and even clue scrolls, so we don't think it's likely to feel overly handhold-y. It's true that once players get to the mainland, they won't have a bunch of highlights telling them what they should be doing, but the key aim here is to build better patterns so that players understand that items can be used on each other, objects in the world have different interactions when clicked, or even really simple things like chatting to the same NPC again for more information if you're stuck on a quest.\n\nWe'd also like to make some changes to the flow of things so that you're focused on learning and interacting with the game rather than reading loads of text or long segments of NPCs talking at you about features that could be better explained elsewhere. Some of the things we're considering are:\n\nMake a dedicated, lightweight UI for the question players are asked about their previous experience, since it's currently housed in a dialogue box that people often just click anything to get rid of. Experienced players may have some different default settings more in-line with what they're already used to.\nMake Tutorial Island a trackable quest/miniquest with its own Quest Journal entry, meaning you'll actually have something to look at when you meet the Quest Guide and something to refer back to if you get stuck or forget what you've already done. Quest Capers do not panic - you'd have this auto-completed, we can't have you going back to Tutorial Island and scaring the new players!\nSlightly speed up the Woodcutting and Fishing action speeds during the tutorial. For players just starting out, waiting 8 ticks to chop a log can lead to them questioning if they're doing something wrong. Once the initial understanding that many actions are 'click and wait' is reached, there's no need for this speed increase, so we're not changing anything on the mainland.\nReplace the Magic Guide's teleport with a Home Teleport step instead. Home Teleport's incredibly useful early-on and is easily missed by new players, plus it feels good to teleport yourself somewhere!\nRemove Brother Brace's introduction to the Friends List. This interrupts the flow of Tutorial Island and stands out since you can't even add friends until you're on the mainland, plus any friends you're likely to add straight away can talk you through it - how social!\nDefault Settings Improvements\n\nHigh up on our list is improving the Default Settings for new players in-line with modern standards. This is the first menu players ever open in the game, despite not knowing what half of it means, and requires a lot of tinkering to find settings that most players will stumble across and wonder why it wasn't always that way. We've got some changes here that impact all new characters, while some will depend on whether players indicate that they're brand new, returning or experienced when prompted at the start of Tutorial Island\n\nDefault Settings changes for all players\nAFK Timer set to 25 minutes.\nGround Items overlay enabled.\nMove follower options lower down: On.\nAuto-equip Worn Items from Gravestone: On.\nHighlight Agility Obstacles: On.\nHighlight Agility Shortcuts: On (based on requirements)\nMax Hitsplat threshold (the minimum max hit you'll need to see that lovely golden outline): 2.\nLoot drop notifications: On. Minimum value: 20,000 GP.\nUntradeable loot notifications: On.\nPlayer Attack options: Always right-click.\nNPC Attack options: Left-click where available.\nPK Skull prevention: On.\nEnable precise timing: On.\nSplit friends private chat: On.\nRune-picking behaviour: On.\nAmmo-picking behaviour: On.\nHide roofs: On.\nEnables new-style Skill guide interfaces: On.\nCollection Log - New addition notifications: On.\nCollection Log - New addition popup: On.\nMusic Volume: 10%\nSound Volume: 20%\nArea Sound Volume: 15%\nDefault Client mode: Resizable - Modern layout.\nCannon low and no ammo notifications: On.\nCannon low notification amount: 10.\nChatbox Mode - Set Automatically: On.\nDefault Settings changes for players who tell us that they're new to the game\nAccept Aid: On\nHiScores Minimenu Lookup: On\nHighlight Quest start points: On.\nFilter Quest start highlights based on requirements: On.\nQuest list sorting: Starter. This is a new sorting category aimed at newer players.\nShow Quests you lack the requirements for: Show as unavailable.\nShow Quests you lack the recommended stats for: Show as unavailable.\nDefault Settings changes for players who tell us that they're returning to the game\nAccept Aid: On\nHiScores Minimenu Lookup: On\n\nWe'd love to hear what you think about these proposals. Our aim isn't to uproot the classic Tutorial Island, but instead to make it clearer to players exactly how they interact with the game so that they're able to see a little more of what it's got to offer before getting frustrated, logging out, and ultimately missing out on an MMO experience that's unlike anything else.\n\nNaturally, the new player experience doesn't end after Tutorial Island - there's still a massive and overwhelming world waiting to be explored, and we think we could offer brand new players a little more guidance.\n\nQuesting & Interface Improvements\n\nBeyond Tutorial Island, we have a handful of other quick wins that we feel we could make to better immerse and inform new players. These ones are likely to land after the changes listed above, so expect to see them in early 2026!\n\nImprove the detail of Quest Journal entries for older/early game quests. While most players opt to use guides to complete these, we feel that the in-game guidance provided could be clearer in a lot of places.\nSimilarly, make some of the dialogue more clear about what's expected from players for early-game quests. We'll take great care to ensure that the tone of Old School's dialogue is preserved while improving players' understanding of the core mechanics they're expected to interact with (talking to NPCs, using items from their inventory, solving a puzzle etc.). The kinds of quests we'd be looking at are things like Cook's Assistant, Sheep Shearer, Romeo & Juliet, The Restless Ghost - the kinds of quests that could very well be the first thing a player does upon reaching the mainland.\nAdd lightweight, beginner-friendly 'Getting started' sections to the in-game Skill guides, accessed by clicking on any icon in the Skills tab.\nPotential New Player Improvements - 2026 and Beyond\n\nImportant Note: This section details changes which we're considering further in the future which we'd like to implement, but want to manage expectations and say that we aren't 100% certain we'll be able to deliver. If something here really stands out that you think would be a great addition for new players, make sure to let us know and help us prioritise!\n\nAt risk of repeating ourselves: don't panic! Much like Tutorial Island, we know that Lumbridge is an equally sacred place and we're not looking to terraform it, construct a bunch of new buildings and fill it full of NPCs that you've never seen before. In truth, the game's starting areas are full of NPCs who provide useful information and do give new players a lot of steer/guidance, but tracking them down on your own can be tricky.\n\nWe'd like to explore some lightweight changes/additions that leverage the locations, quests and NPCs that we've already got so that players who select the 'I'm a brand new player' option on Tutorial Island receive some kind of direction to get them going. Our aims here are to make changes that aren't invasive for experienced players, that stay true both visually and tonally to the rest of Old School, and that focus on players building up confidence with the game's core progression systems so that they can make their own decisions without feeling overwhelmed or second-guessing themselves constantly.\n\nSomething important for you to know is that we do have plans to do 'bigger' and more long-term work to improve the First Time User Experience throughout 2026, but our focus between now and the end of the year will be on short-term technical fixes (like you've seen with the Tutorial Island changes) while we work through fleshing out the more grandiose stuff. We'll avoid going into detail on our thoughts here because these bigger beats need fleshing out and would be better discussed once we've got more to share.\n\nWith all that in mind, here's a top-level overview of those smaller, tactical changes that we're considering which we'd love to hear your thoughts on! Keep in mind that these changes would be visible to new players only and ideally not visible if you're a veteran player making an alternate character, with the exception of the Quest Tab/Journal and Skill Guide tweaks listed below.\n\nLumbridge\nBetter direct new players to the Activity Advisor - it's easy to miss!\nConsider some gentle guidance towards some early game staples like Cook's Assistant, Sheep Shearer, Rune Mysteries, or Romeo & Juliet.\nWe could achieve this via a light-weight UI element like an overlay, dialogue or overhead messaging with citizens throughout Lumbridge, or through a 'quest breadcrumb' approach that kicks off with some kind of greeter NPC.\nDeclutter the World Map for new players around Lumbridge. We could do this by progressively revealing more icons as new players progress, adding a 'Beginner' filter to the map that turns off after a short time, or hiding unusable icons until players can interact with them.\nOn arrival to the mainland, get players to chat to a greeter NPC (e.g. the Lumbridge Guide) for some initial direction or to set the stage for players knowing what they could do to kick off their journey.\nFind ways to adjust or rework Adventure Paths to reduce the lack of clarity after they're completed. Many new players find this system useful but feel like the tasks laid before them don't tie in with the wider game very well, leading to a lack of clarity about what to do afterwards.\nQuests\nImprove the Quest Journal UX:\nDisplay requirements with skill icons and clear formatting.\nDisplay rewards from various quests (opt-in, to avoid spoilers)\nImprove filtering to allow for a 'recommended' section of the Quest tab, using similar data to the Activity Advisor to make recommendations based on player progression. Additionally, explore filtering by: skill XP rewards, whether or not Combat is a core part of the quest and how many Quest Points are awarded.\nThis includes things like explaining why a quest is recommended and showing how far off of the requirements you are.\nConsider lightweight dialogue additions for Quest givers whose requirements you don't meet so that they can point you in another direction. Meaning they'll tell you which requirements you don't meet and suggest another quest or activity you could get on with in the mean time. This dialogue would have to make diegetic sense, meaning dialogue more like \"Perhaps you should chat to the Cook in Lumbridge, he seems like he needs constant help\" as opposed to \"Go and do the Cook's Assistant quest\".\nAllow players to 'pin' a Quest for easy access rather than navigating through their Quest tab to find it repeatedly. If we can make this work, allow the most recent notes in the Quest Journal for the pinned Quest to be visible on-screen as a lightweight Quest tracker.\nAdd post-Quest recaps to their respective journal entries. These would detail a top-level overview of the story, notable characters you encountered, rewards that you earned and any significant pieces of content or follow-up Quests that you unlocked.\nRemove the 'strike-through' from completed Quest Journal entries and find a different way to display this information. While it's nice to know what you have and haven't done, the current display can make it annoying to refer back to previous steps for information.\nMiscellaneous\nAdd lightweight, beginner-friendly 'How to train' and 'Quests that give (skill) XP' sections to the in-game Skill guides, accessed by clicking on any icon in the Skills tab.\nRemove the inventory/bank restriction on claiming more runes and arrows from the Magic and Ranged tutors. We'd also consider bumping up the number of runes offered by the Magic tutor, since you currently only get enough to kill a handful of cows at most.\nAdd a right-click 'Bury' option to dropped bones to alleviate some friction for early-game Prayer. We know that experienced players may never bury a bone, but the extra step of picking it up and then burying it is needless friction for beginners.\nUse skill icons on the Combat Styles tab to indicate more clearly which skills will be granted XP by each of the different style options.\nAdd toggle stat tooltips for items that you hover over or long press since new players often have difficulty understanding the stats from items, particularly things like negative Magic bonus from Melee armour.\n\nThere's a whole lot of stuff listed here, and that's only the 'quick' wins! Some of these - particularly the Quest- or dialogue-related entries - are likely to be bigger projects than they seem on the surface, so we'd like to make clear that these are all things that we'd like to do but can't guarantee that we'll get to immediately. Of course, if anything listed is ringing alarm bells for you then make sure to let us know and we can always reconsider!\n\nYou're all caught up! That's a full look at the short-term, tech/UI/UX-focused changes we'd like to make so that we can better improve the onboarding experience for new players.\n\nLike we've said throughout the blog, let us know your thoughts, comments, queries or concerns in all of the usual places and we'll make any adjustments that feel necessary. Remember that this isn't everything we'd like to look at to improve FTUE, so keep an eye out through 2026 for some discussions on more long-term and large-scale projects.\n\nYou can also discuss this update on the 2007Scape subreddit, the Steam forums, or the community-led OSRS Discord in the #gameupdate channel.

    "title": "Introducing Poll System Improvements",
    "link": "https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/a=13/introducing-poll-system-improvements?oldschool=1",
    "content": "We’re revamping our Poll system to be better than ever!\n\nIf you can't see this image, click here!\n\nPolls have always been the backbone of Old School RuneScape, giving you the final say on what content makes it into the game and making sure it stays true to the spirit of Old School. It is one of the most unique things about OSRS. Truly, this is democracy manifest!\n\nThe system has served us well over the years, but it is also a little limited. Until now, we have only been able to ask very simple, tick-box questions, and even then, we have been tied up by the tech behind the system. We know that sometimes this left us unable to get a full picture of how the community was feeling about an idea.\n\nThat is why we are expanding what the Poll System can do. These changes will not affect the Polling Charter or the 70% pass rate, that core principle remains untouched. Instead, we are giving ourselves more ways to hear from you, to test the waters before big decisions, and to make sure your feedback is shaping the game at every step.\n\nSo, let’s dive into the improvements that will make polling more flexible, more engaging, and more informative than ever before.\n\nWhy The Change?\n\nWhat do we mean when we talk about the Poll system being limited?\n\nQuestion types are limited: We can only ask simple, single-choice questions, which means feedback is often too black-and-white.\nPoll timing is clunky: Launching or closing a poll requires certain developers with specific access to be online at the right moment. On top of that, we can only run one poll at a time. Some updates have been pushed back because we simply can't poll what is required for the time it'd be ready for release.\nSurvey fatigue is real: When we need deeper insight we sometimes send out external surveys, but these can often suffer from fewer responses the more we send, and it's not ideal having to pull people away from the game.\n\nThe new system addresses all of these problems. It makes polling more flexible, more accessible, and more player-friendly.\n\nWhat’s New In The Improved Poll System?\nNew Question Types\n\nWe can now go far beyond simple Yes/No. Examples include:\n\nSingle-choice\n\nSame as before, but still essential for Yes/No decisions.\n\nQuestion 1: Same as before, but still essential for Yes/No decisions.\n\n  Yes\n  No\n  Skip\nMultiple-choice\n\nPick several options from a list, perfect for things like “Which of these rewards interest you most?”.\n\nQuestion 2: Which themes would you like for a future cape design? (Choose up to 2).\n\n  Completionist Cape\n  More Max Cape Variants\n  Third option (C)\n  Fourth option (D)\nFree-text\n\nType your own response directly in-game, useful for gathering opinions in your own words.\n\nQuestion 3: Explain why you will never be able to defeat Cuthbert, Lord of Dread.\n\nType Your Answer:  \nRanked\n\nSort a list by preference, e.g. which skills or features should we prioritise.\n\nQuestion 4: Rank your favourite Lil' Zik Transmogs.\n\nMaiden\nBloat\nNylo\nSot\nXarp\nMatrix\n\nAnswer a set of related questions at once, like rating different aspects of an idea.\n\nQuestion 5: Rate each Sailing training method on a scale from “strongly dislike” to “strongly like.”\n\n\tStrongly like\tLike\tNeutral\tDislike\tStrongly dislike\tSkip\nCourier Tasks\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nBounty Tasks\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nSea Charting\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nShipwreck salvaging\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nBarracuda Trials\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nThese new question types mean we can get a fuller picture of how you feel and why.\n\nPoll Formatting\n\nIf you can't see this image, click here!\n\nPolls can now include in-game text blocks, images, headers, and even links that take you to blogs or bigger design explanations. This means we can provide more context directly inside the poll menu without you always needing to leave the game.\n\nDifferent Poll Types\n\nIf you can't see this image, click here!\n\nNot everything has to be a formal Yes/No vote. We now have the ability to run:\n\nLock-in polls: A lock-in poll is a commitment to release the proposed update if it reaches the usual 70% pass and remains reasonably possible for us to ship. If we hit problems during development, we may change or cancel the update, and we will explain why if that happens.\nGreenlight polls: A greenlight poll asks whether we should explore the idea further. If it reaches the usual 70% pass, we will develop a fuller design and bring it back via a lock-in poll so you can decide whether to commit to it being added to the game.\nExamples: \"Do you want Raids 4, details will be revealed at a later date, and rewards will be polled separately\" this would be considered to be a Lock-in poll rather than greenlight, as it has been in the past. A typical Greenlight poll might instead look like \"Should we explore adding a new area to the game themed around cabbages?\" - the emphasis on exploring adding something that is not fully fleshed out, but will give us a good indication on whether or not you feel like it's worth us spending time refining an idea further before we fully commit to adding it to the game via a Lock-in poll.\nOpinion surveys: Flexible questionnaires that let us gather input before content is ready to share for wider feedback.\n\nThese two new poll types are especially useful for early-stage designs, where we’d rather hear your thoughts first before locking anything in!\n\nEligibility\n\nBy default, polls will still require members with 25 hours of playtime and 300 total levels. But now we have tools to refine eligibility for specific polls or even specific questions.\n\nFor example, we might want feedback from players of a certain combat level, or restrict a question to players who’ve engaged with a particular piece of content. These are mainly going to be used for opinion-based polls or survey questions, rather than content than might be coming into the game.\n\nIf we feel there is a need for addition requirements to vote on a particular poll question, we will use this with care. We’d like to share our thoughts on how we believe it will work:\n\nDefault stays broad: Content polls that add to the game will continue to follow the standard rules, including the 70% pass requirement and the usual account eligibility. Targeting is mainly for opinion polls or surveys where specialist input helps.\nWays for everyone to be heard: When we target a question to specialists, we will look to pair it with a wider opinion poll, a free-text question, or a survey open to a broader audience. This helps us capture both expert experience and general sentiment.\nClear reasons, shared in advance: If we plan to restrict a poll or a question, we will say so before it goes live. We will explain who is eligible, how the criteria work, and why this approach is better for that case. For example, we may ask only players with experience of a boss to rate its drop table, while still running a separate opinion poll open to everyone.\nSimple, game-relevant criteria: Criteria will be based on in-game progress you can understand and verify, such as a quest completed, kill count, total level, league rank, or a recent activity flag.\nNot a blanket change: We are still exploring the best use cases. Targeted questions will be the exception, not the rule. We will review results and share a short note on who was eligible and why, so the process is clear.\nExample you might see in-game: This question is visible to players with at least 10 Vorkath kills. We are using this criterion to collect feedback from players familiar with the fight. A separate opinion poll on Vorkath is open to all players.\nRunning Multiple Polls\n\nThe new system lets us run more than one poll at a time, something we couldn’t do before. That means smaller, targeted polls won’t need to wait for the big headline content polls to finish.\n\nAutomation and Scheduling\n\nIt will be possible for Polls to be scheduled in advance, opening and closing automatically. This removes the need for manual intervention and ensures everything runs on time. It also means we can tease polls early by making them visible in the game before voting begins!\n\nA New Look For Web & A More Robust System!\n\nWhile the poll section on the Old School website holds a lot of nostalgic charm, is has been well overdue a revamp, which includes presenting the results in the same way the game does! No more inconsistencies with voting %'s as we'll finally be counting skip votes in the results displayed! Hurrah!\n\nIn addition to this, the new system is much more robust! While there have only been a small number of occasions where poll data became corrupted due to unforeseen circumstances (requiring us to re-run a poll entirely!), the new system is far more robust with the data consistency which will help alleviate the chances of that happening.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThat is everything we are ready to share for now. The improved Poll System gives us the tools to gather your thoughts in more meaningful ways, while still holding onto the principle that has defined Old School since 2013: if it is coming into the game, it needs 70% of your votes.\n\nWith these changes, you will see more variety in the kinds of questions we ask, more opportunities to share your views, and smoother processes behind the scenes to make sure polls run on time. From opinion polls that test early ideas, to flexible question types that go beyond a simple “yes or no,” this is about giving you more ways to shape the game you love.\n\nWhat's even more exciting is that we're also going to be bringing in all the data from previous polls, meaning you will have the power to see what you voted for in each one! Have fun going back in time and seeing how past you voted!\n\nMod Lykos\nBecause polls have been so important to OSRS's history, we wanted to make sure we did them justice. We think there's a subset of long-time players that will really get a kick out of going through the older ones and seeing what they had voted for (or against) at the time.\n\nWe are excited to roll out the new system soon and cannot wait to see what you think of it. As always, keep an eye on the News page and our socials for details on when the first improved poll will go live, and be ready to make your voice heard!\n\nYou can also discuss this update on the 2007Scape subreddit, the Steam forums, or the community-led OSRS Discord in the #gameupdate channel.

Any hats collected through this menu over the past few weeks will be added to the collection log and trigger any achievement diary task completion on login.\nOrder has been restored to the spelling of 'Chaos fanatic' in the rune pouch load-out menu.\nThe world map hotkey tooltip has been mildly shortened and will no longer show if you've toggled it off.\nLooting the Moon chest from now on will no longer attribute the loot to Tormented demons.\nGrammar corrections have been made to Ava's and Azzanadra's dialogue.\nPvP Rota\n\nThe PvP rota has moved to Period B\n\n560 - (UK) - PvP World\n319 - (US) - Bounty Hunter World\n579 - (US) - High-Risk PvP World\n561 - (UK) - Free-to-Play PvP World\n580 - (US) - LMS Competitive\n\nWorld 390 (AUS) for LMS Competitive has been de-activated with this rota.\n\nWorld 569 (AUS) for Bounty Hunter has been de-activated with this rota.\n\nThe PvP Arena is using 'Max/Med' loadouts in Ranked Duels and Tournaments this week.\n\nGrid Master\n\nToday's the day for Grid Master's launch, Old School RuneScape's very first community event!
